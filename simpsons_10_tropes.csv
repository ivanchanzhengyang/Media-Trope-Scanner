Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the

uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover future costs Bart then undergoes a “James Bond”style operation Back at home Lisa tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out Marge tells him to calm down and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus further for the year Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk choosing to conceal the truth Once outside he looks at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair on the sidewalkMarge senses something is amiss with Homer and asks if there is something wrong Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping so she doesnt have to Marge agrees and is content with Homers answer the two sleep The next day Homer does the Christmas shopping alone at Circus of Values He purchases pantyhose for Marge pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie While purchasing such dismal presents Homer uses empty optimism to assure his own self On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned and Todd while he carries an armful of fancily wrapped packages All the presents are spilled onto the ground and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought Ned attempts to sort the presents unintentionally gloating his wealth At Moes Tavern Homer drinks a beer alone when a cheerful Barney arrives wearing a Santa Claus costume Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a parttime job acting as a department store Santa at the mall Homer suddenly has an idea so he goes to the personnel

save the Simpson family ChristmasPatty Selma Abe Simpson Marge Maggie and Lisa wait for Homer and Bart to come home while watching a The Happy Little Elves Christmas special Meanwhile at the dog track Barney insists Homer should bet on Whirlwind After seeing what Whirlwind looks like Homer is reluctant to bet on him Just then an announcement plays over the PA system a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing Sir Galahad in the fourth race Bart senses that the announcement is an omen and chooses to ask Homer to bet on him and despite the fact that the odds are ninetynine to one which

nose over here so you can guide my sleigh today However in the end Bart interrupts once again causing Homer to strangle Bart while shouting Why you littleSimpsons Roasting on an Open FireTranscriptThe Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the episode finished thirtieth in the week of December 11–17 1989 It concluded with a Nielsen rating of 145 and was viewed in approximately 134 million homes,homer

Bart the Genius,The Simpson family is playing Scrabble in the living room in an effort to build Bart’s vocabulary for his aptitude test the next day at school Bart however hates the game so he ends it when he cheats and makes up an imaginary word “Kwyjibo” Before he leaves Homer roughly grabs Bart and accuses him of cheating He then forces him to define Kwyjibo Bart eventually defines it as “A big dumb balding North American ape with no chin” Marge adds minor detail to the definition of Kwyjibo with and a short temper This causes Homer to become instantly angered and chases Bart out of the room as Bart replies Uhoh Kwyjibo on the looseThe next day before class in the schoolyard Bart is spraypainting graffiti that defames Principal Skinner on the school building Principal Skinner is watching the kids on the playground Martin Prince the school genius tattles about the graffiti Milhouse one of Barts friends sees Martin informing Skinner and warns Bart Skinner arrives where Bart Milhouse and

Krabappel hands out aptitude tests to everyone When she instructs the class on taking the timed intelligence test Martin raises his hand and reminds her that Bart is supposed to face the window during any test so he can’t cheat A grumbling Bart turns his desk to face the window and the test begins In an attempt to figure out a lengthy math word problem Bart tries to quietly read the problem so he can solve it Mrs Krabappel reminds him for visualization instead The visualization turns into a daydream and when Bart finally comes back to reality Martin announces that he has finished his test already Mrs Krabappel allows Martin go outside to read a book during the remainder of the testing period While Bart is still taking his test he looks out the window to see a smug Martin sticking his tongue out at him In retaliation Bart sticks his tongue out and makes faces back at Martin after Martin does the same Mrs Krabappel spots Bart making faces and looks out the window to see what Bart is looking at While her back is turned Bart who is seated at the front of the class reaches over to Mrs Krabappel’s desk and steals Martin’s test replaces Martin’s name with his own and then puts the

Skinner’s office for a meeting about Bart’s behavior at school Skinner informs Marge and Homer about Bart’s graffiti from earlier that morning As he reaches for Bart’s rather extensive permanent

the meeting and surprises everyone when he tells them that Bart is a “gifted child” and according to the aptitude test from earlier Bart has an IQ of 216 Dr Pryor suggests that Bart’s history of bad behavior stems from a lack of interest in his school work due to the fact that it is too easy for him Skinner wants Bart retested but when Dr Pryor suggests moving Bart to a school for gifted children Skinner jumps on board with the idea and Bart quickly agrees when he hears that the school doesn’t have much structure and that you get to make your own rules Dr Pryor hands Bart some paperwork for the “gifted children” school and he Homer and Marge leave the meeting stunnedThe next morning at the breakfast table Marge and Homer hover around their new genius child and Homer tells Lisa to start eating what Bart eats for breakfast so she can become a genius too However Lisa is not fooled by Bart and knows that he is still just a dimwit After breakfast Homer takes Bart to the “Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children” Once inside the school they find Bart’s class and after peeking in they see that all the boys are wearing ties So Homer gives Bart the tie he is wearing and he gives Bart a little pep talk about his first day at the new school and shoves him in the classroom door Once inside the class Ms Mellon the teacher introduces herself and the new classmates to Bart and shows him around the classroom She tells Bart about the independent learning and that the only rule is for him to make his own rules Class begins with a debate on the topic of free will and the paradoxes that it creates Bart struggles to understand the discussion Later at lunch Bart’s classmates realize that Bart isn’t really that smart when he accepts their ridiculously uneven trade offers

his room when Homer walks in to see about Bart’s first day at the new school Homer suggests they all go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes and Bart agrees Just then Marge walks by and tells Homer and Bart that she bought tickets to the opera in an effort to try to help nurture Bart’s brain Later during the opera a bored and impatient Homer and Bart goof off and cut each other up even though they

names and tell him to get lost Cut to later at dinner as a depressed Bart eats Marge reminds everyone that they can’t be late for the film festival that she bought tickets for as another way to nurture Bart’s brain Bart is reluctant to go to the festival and Homer tells him they don’t have to Just as Bart is about to tell Homer what is on his mind and confess about the false IQ test Homer insists on going outside to play catch After playing catch Bart sees how much being a genius means to Homer and chooses not to confess about what he has done out of fear of disappointing himThe next day at the “gifted children” school while performing a chemistry experiment Bart accidentally causes an explosion which results in green goo everywhere Later at Dr Pyror’s office a greenstained Bart

AfricanAmerican instead of yellow According to David Silverman Gyorgi Peluci the color stylist randomly planned the ethnicity of various characters which usually wasnt much of a problem but it sort of ruined the white sycophant personality for Smithers In his next appearance he was colored right but still with blue hair Although Mr Burns was seen in Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire this was his first appearance in order of production codes as well as the first use of his name hence the dramatic music when the camera pans out on himWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood the authors of the book I Cant

Theres No Disgrace Like Home,Bart and Lisa are fighting but it is not long until Homer quickly rushes in to break the melee up He tells them to get the bad behavior out of their system because they are going to Mr Burns’ company picnic and he doesn’t want his family to embarrass him in front of Mr Burns When the family arrives at Mr Burns mansion for the picnic Homer once again reminds his family that they have to behave in a normal manner Bart and Lisa quickly run off to play in the water fountain and Homer chases after them leaving Marge and Maggie behind Another woman carrying a baby approaches Marge and suggests to place the babies in the nursery and grab a drink together Marge is reluctant about drinking but then after seeing Homer chase Bart and Lisa around the backyard she chooses to have a glass of punch Its soon time for the fatherson sack race and Homer pressures Bart to not have them beating Mr Burns Meanwhile Marge is conversing with all the wives of the workers she becomes tipsy from the amount of punch she drank Back to the sack race where Smithers gives Mr Burns a head start and then fires the starting gun Mr Burns is out in front of everyone when suddenly Bart plans to make a break for the finish line Homer quickly hops up ahead and tackles Bart just short of the finish line allowing Mr Burns to finish first Meanwhile Marge intoxicated leads all the women in a song and dance number when Homer runs by and is shocked at Marge’s behavior He quickly whisks her away from the punch and tells her to keep it together because Mr Burns is about to give a toastOne of us One of us One of usHomer hallucinates Bart Lisa Marge and Maggie as demonsEveryone at the picnic gathers as Mr Burns gives a toast He thanks everyone for coming but tells them all to leave immediately as he threatens to release the hounds in ten minutes Everyone heads out and Homer notices the family ahead of them the son gives the father a kiss and tells him he had a great time Mr Burns is impressed by this family but is insulted by Homers pathetic attempt to gain his favor Later on Homer confronts the man from the “perfect” family ahead of him and tells him he can stop the fake cornball routine However the man reveals his family are actually nice normal people in real life and dont act like this only at gatherings When the man admits pitying him Homer finally realizes the truththat his own family has a problem He watches a son from the normal family lets his sister enter the back seat like a gentleman She politely thanks him for the gesture Homer witnesses Lisa and Bart arguing and fighting over seats He turns his attention to the mans wife who is offering her husband to rest and she can drive home The man politely refuses and starts the car Homer then turns his attention to Marge whos still intoxicated and asking him to drive home before she throws up in his car He imagines the mans family driving off to Heaven while he is driving his own family in Hell Homer goes back home in his reality now knowing how much Marge Bart and Lisa embarrassed him in front of his bossThe next day Marge and the kids eat TV dinners in the living room and watch TV together when Homer walks in and plans that tonight they are all going to eat at the dinner table like a normal family At the dinner table the rest of the Simpsons are not taking Homers attempt to get them to eat like a normal family seriously and continue eating like cavemen During his prayer Homer expresses his dissatisfaction with his troubled familys behavior and ponders why he was cursed with those who disrespect him When Marge and the kids claim there is nothing is wrong with the family Homer chooses to prove that there is something wrong with them He leads the family in a tour around the neighborhood peeking into random houses to observe their neighbors’ normal family life However the rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homers sudden rash behavior in the tour and tries to convince him that theyre normal like everyone else who have familiar problems like them He refuses to believe them pointing out that normal families converses with each other about their day and eat at the dinner table not ignore a family member and eating dinner while watching TV in the living room A neighbor notices Homer spying on his family and fires warning rounds from his shotgun By the time they got back to the safety of their house Marge tells him off that she thinks the trip is unnecessary because she and the kids feel like stalkers invading their entire neighborhoods privacies with their families They quickly retreat back inside to continue watching TVDepressed by this matter Homer visits Moes Tavern for a drink and to get away from his problems Two patrolmen enter the bar claiming they received reports of a neighborhood stalker The dog suspects Homer and growls at them to pay attention Luckily for him the two cops are too dumb to notice anything and drag the dog away After getting into a brief fight with Barney Homer later sees a commercial for Dr Marvin Monroes Family Therapy Center Dr Monroe guarantees family bliss or double your money back Homer then gets an idea to make his family normalMarge and the kids watch an Itchy  Scratchy cartoon when Homer walks in the living room and announces he has made an appointment at Dr Monroe’s Family Therapy Center The family is reluctant to the idea but Homer is on a mission to make his family better Marge tries to claim that theres still nothing wrong with their family but Homer doesnt listen In order to raise the 250 needed for the session Homer pawns the TV much to the rest of the familys horrorThe therapy treatment begins as Dr Monroe brings them into another room and sits them down He encourages them each to draw a picture that represents the source of their unhappiness Most of the Simpsons vent their anger out by drawing Homer as they see him while Homer gets lost in the exercise by drawing airplanes dropping bombs on his family When Dr Monroe sees this he points out to Homer that had he been paying attention he wouldve known his family sees him as an abusive and stern disciplinarian Monroe also calls him an ogre a word that Marge and Lisa disagree with claiming ogre is too much Bart agrees with Monroe making Homer furious enough to attack him Dr Monroe calms Homer down and asks the family to try different exercises such as the foam padded aversion mallets that Bart turns into a hard weapon by removing the foam padding from his mallet and striking Dr Monroe with it Soon Dr Monroe sees that the Simpson family is not responding to conventional treatment so his next exercise becomes different He places each of the Simpsons in their own chair hooked up to deliver an electric shock Each chair has buttons that when pressed will deliver an electric shock to another corresponding chair With all of the Simpsons strapped in Dr Monroe instructs them only to shock someone else if that person hurts them emotionally However the family members quickly start shocking each other over minor slights and then things go totally off the rails when Maggie starts hitting all the buttons at random leading to a power brownout across the entire city much to Mr Burns joy as this increased use of electricity means more money for his companyDr Monroe soon tires of the Simpsons and unplugs the generator He tells them that theyre beyond his help and orders them to leave but Homer refuses reminding Monroe of his doublemoney back guarantee Dr Monroe grudingly agrees and furiously hands over 500 while ordering them to leave and never tell anyone they were ever there The family leaves more than satisfied given their unexpected windfall and cannot help but feel more united Homer decides to use the money to buy a brand new TV and the Simpsons happily head homeTheres No Disgrace Like HomeTranscriptThe episode shows telltale signs of being one of the earliest shows of the season produced The characters act slightly different from how they would in later seasons For example Lisa is an undisciplined brat Marge is a drunk and inattentive whereas Homer is concerned and the voice of reason for his family It was an early episode for Mr Burns in which he had a voice different from the one it would later become Originally the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan which was later dropped The idea that he would greet his employees using index cards was inspired by how Ronald Reagan would greet people The episode marks the first time Burns says release the hounds It also marked the first appearance of Eddie and Lou although Lou was not black but instead yellow like the rest of the characters Lou was named after Lou Whitaker  a former Major League Baseball player It is the first appearance of Itchy  Scratchy although the cat and mouse duo appeared in the shortsThe idea behind the scene in which the family take turns to electrically shock each other was based on Laurel and Hardy throwing pies at each other albeit played out more sadistically The scene was rearranged in the editing room because when it was first produced it played out differently The edits made to the finished product were preliminary however they were received well and remained unchangedBurns and SmithersThis episode marks the introduction of Dr Marvin Monroe Itchy and Scratchy and Eddie and Lou two of Springfields policemen Lou was colored yellow by mistake in this episode same mistake made in Krusty Gets Busted though he is later an AfricanAmerican and Smithers who was drawn as an AfricanAmerican in the previous episode is drawn in yellow a shade or two lighter than Burns in this one This episode also marks the first use of Burns release the hounds commentThe authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood note Its very strange to see Homer pawning the TV set in an attempt to save the family if this episode had come later Marge would surely have taken this stance They continue A neat swipe at family counseling with some great set pieces were especially fond of the perfect version of the Simpsons and the electricshock aversion therapy In a DVD review of the first season David B Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2050 placing it as one of the worst of the seasonThis episode would have been one of the first seen by British viewers It was the first episode to be broadcast by the BBC on November 23 1996 on a Saturday at 530pm because the episodes were shown out of order The episode was screened with five million viewers that was slightly less than the show Dads Army a British series revolving around a misfit military platoon which previously held the timeslot The episode also faced competition from ITVs screening of Sabrina the Teenage Witch This was unless you had a subscription to SKY TV in the 90s as they showed the episodes in order from September 2 1990 the first being The Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire It was said to be the savior of Sky TV from being an instant failureThe scene where the family turn electrically shocking each other would later appear in the film Die Hard 2 Die Harder,bart and lisa be fight but it be not long until homer quickly rush in to break the melee up he tell them to get the bad behavior out of their system because they be go

image of the Simpson house David Silverman was the director and was kind of stressed because he was doing storyboards for this episode while also directing Bart the Genius Originally he had planned to use the song “War” by Edwin Starr in the episode The plans were dropped when they agreed that the song did not really fit the story The episode had problems with the censors who did not want the characters to say family jewels on prime time television The producers ignored the notes and family jewels remained in the episodeTwo new characters were introduced in this episode The first one is Nelson Muntz who remains a commonly used recurring character The second is Herman who has been used less The design of Herman except for only having one arm was inspired by the look of the writer John Swartzwelder The voice was partly inspired by George H W Bush and performed by Harry Shearer The original idea with Herman was that every time he would be shown he would have a different story to why he only has one armMatt Groening notes on the commentary track that he finds it strange how controversial this episode seemed at the time of its release Today they would go a lot further and to him this episode now seems harmless The authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said Some good lines and set pieces aside

knows her family cant afford it Convinced in wanting to buy the RV to one up Flanders Homer asks him for the price Bob takes him into the office and goes over the rules He reveals that though he owns the place Bob still has to run a credit check on his computer for business and security protocol before they can proceed with the deal for the Ultimate Behemoth A siren alerts him but Homer assumes its sound means he has been approved However Bob tells Homer that hes been rejected and it was the computers way of warning the owner not to proceed with the deal It turns out the Ultimate Behemoth is

show is about to start but he offers them free tickets In the audience a visibly saddened Bart watches the show When Sideshow Bob notices Barts sadness he invites him on stage for a new psychological segment of the show called Choices While on stage Bart reveals he is sad because he thinks that Krusty was framed and wrongfully jailed but Bob tries to convince him otherwise brushing off the clues he and Lisa found by claiming that Krusty was never one to follow doctors orders seriously and pointing out that The Springfield Review of Books contains amusing caricatures that anyone can enjoy Bob

connects the final piece of the mystery together recalling that Homer stepped on the robbers toes and made him scream in pain However when he and Lisa saw Krusty going into the courtroom they noticed that he had normal sized feet Bart believes if he had actually been there at the KwikEMart and Homer step on his shoes he would never felt it Remembering that Bob has feet large enough to fill Krustys clown shoes from their attempt to speak to him Bart concludes that Bob is the real robber and he was the one who yelled at Homer for stepping on his feetOutraged by the truth Bart rightfully levels his accusation towards Sideshow Bob He grabs the microphone and contends to the audience about his new discovery Bart then proves his point by smashing the end of Bobs clown shoe with a mallet This causes Bob to scream in pain and say the exact words spoken by the robber much to the kids shock Bart pounds Bobs other foot causing him to fall down and removes his shoes to expose his big feet on TV

studio an arrested and exposed Bob dramatically confesses to the crime He reveals that he framed Krusty for the KwikEMart robbery out of frustration because he finally got sick of constantly being on the receiving end of Krustys humiliating antics for more ratings as well as the fact that Krusty squandered much of the shows profits on gambling and other examples of his vulgar appetites Bob felt his intelligence was wasted on the show and wanted Krusty gone so he could make an educational program where his intelligence would be appreciated by the public Before being carted off to jail Bob pays a grudging kudos to the Simpson children with the often used line from ScoobyDoo I would have gotten away with it too if it hadnt been for those meddling kids and swears revenge on Bart for foiling his plan He dramatically warns criminals to start treating children as equals because they were smart enough to catch him and will do the same to them The charges against Krusty are dropped and he now regains the trust of the community Chief Wiggum and the citizens apologize to Krusty for their misunderstanding and Homer offers an apology for fingering him in court Grateful to be free

still yapping at Bart for the Oliver Clozoff prank and hangs up assuming that it was a crossed wire She picks it up again and calls the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting Service However the receptionist immediately freaks out telling her that she must be kidding when Marge identifies herself as Mrs Simpson She quickly refuses their services to the Simpson children due to their bad reputation with the babysitting service for a long time which resulted in the Simpsons being blacklisted from being babysat by them Not giving up in the slightest Homer then calls under the alias Homer Samson and hires a rather rude babysitter named Miss BotzWhen Miss Botz arrives with two suspicious looking suitcases nonetheless Marge whos already pampered up for her night with Homer whos also pampered up tells her that Maggie has to go to sleep immediately but Bart and Lisa can stay up for an hour longer and watch The Happy Little Elves Meet the Curious Bear Cub much to Barts horror and hatred of the elves When Bart tries to suggest alternate viewing in order to avoid watching the elves Miss Botz quickly puts him in his place by mentioning that she dealt with troublesome children like him before and makes him watch the video with Lisa while she puts Maggie to bed After a while Bart starts to get sick of the elves so he plans to switch to Americas Most Armed and Dangerous where the host is talking to the audience about the notorious Babysitter Bandit whose real name is Lucille Botzcowski The host also warns the viewers that she might be using a clever alias He then shows a mugshot of the criminal on TV who looks just like Miss BotzLater as if on cue Miss Botz who really is the Babysitter Bandit comes into the room which scares Bart and Lisa as they scream and run out of the room to hide Bart hides in the basement while Lisa goes into the kitchen and tries to call 1800USQUEAL on the phone When Miss Botz tries to look for Bart in the basement he tries to knock her out with Marges bowling ball but to no avail as Bart drops onto the floor and Miss Botz notices him thus getting caught by her In the kitchen Lisa reports over the phone about Miss Botz but Miss Botz is behind her pulling her in with a rope Lisa notices this but just as when she is in the middle of reporting about the bandit Miss Botz captures LisaBack in the living room Miss Botz puts Bart and Lisa on the couch and ties them up Bart keeps on talking and moaning that she wont get away with it making Miss Botz tape Barts mouth up thus being gagged and cant talk Miss Botz then turns on the Happy Little Elves video again for them which bothers Bart a lot more as he makes noises from underneath the tape Eventually a smug Lisa tells him to shut up and make the best of the situation Meanwhile Homer and Marge are enjoying a fancy dinner at Chez Paree having lobsters Once done with their meal they go to the Ye Olde OffRamp Inn where Marge has some time together with Homer in their hotel roomBack at the house Maggie wakes up and goes downstairs to find her siblings tied up just as The Happy Little Elves video ends Bart has finally had it with the elves so he pounds his head on the couch in anger Lisa tells Maggie that she will be able to watch the video again if she unties her Maggie complies saving the day once moreThe kids then decide to plan a strategy to kidnap Miss Botz Maggie goes up the stairs and is nearby her parents room where Lucille Botzcowski is robbing their closet Botzcowski tired of the incompetent and bothersome Simpson children follows Maggies pacifier sucking sounds and into Barts room with the lights off where she is hit on the head by Bart wielding a baseball bat It turns out that Bart was also using Maggies pacifier to accomplish the deed Meanwhile Marge discovers that there is no answer at home due to Miss Botz disabling all of the phones in the home Back at home with no way to call about the bandit from their home Bart Lisa and Maggie rush outside to a local pay phone and alert the authorities but not before tying Lucille Botzcowski up and gagging her and then forcing her to watch The Happy Little Elves videoMarge and Homer arrive home still worried about not getting an answer Eventually they find Lucille Botzcowski bound and gagged and after they ungag her she begs them to turn off the tape and warns Homer not to take his eyes off of Bart for a second They then send her home with all of her suitcases in which the stolen items are contained which Homer and Marge didnt notice plus three times her regular pay The police then arrive along with the media but as Bart tries to lead them to the living room Homer grabs Bart by the shirt and berates him for his behavior towards Miss Botz However Homers cut off by a reporter who asks him if hes saying that he unwittingly aided the escape of the Babysitter Bandit Realizing his mistake a humiliated Homer tries to save face by claiming that he fought Miss Botz before she escaped much to the childrens dismayLater Homer and Marge are in bed where Homer is watching himself looking foolish on television so he turns it off while lamenting about being branded a boob by the entire community remarking that he just isnt that bright Marge says that she loves him the way he is and that if he has three children who managed to capture a criminal by themselves he must be doing something right She then kisses Homer as she turns the lamp off for bedtimeA work print of the episode was the first to come back from Korea as episodes of The Simpsons are often animated overseas to a South Korean animation studio AKOM due to the overload of episodes and saving costs in Korea The Simpsons Shorts where everything was produced inhouse in KlaskyCsupo although the domestic studio produces only the character and background layout of episodes The original rough version of Some Enchanted Evening is incomplete as it ends when Bart and Lisa just find out Miss Botz is Americas Most Wanted and sound effects and a soundtrack are absent and would have been inserted had there been a final version The work print was not well received in the Gracie Films bungalow with James L Brooks giving a response with profanity Some Enchanted Evening was the first one produced explaining why its 7G01The Simpsons Pilot EpisodeSome scenes of the original version of the episodeThe producers wanted a realistic environment for The Simpsons as other studios had unrealistic styles for animation such as Disney Warner Bros HannaBarbera etc The former two had a universe where the universe was bendy and characters seemed to be made out of rubber HannaBarbera used cartoon sounds which were also declined While the shorts lacked much realism in animation the halfhour series had been intended to be as realistic as possible despite the unrealistic animation 70 of the episodes had to be redone The episode was worked on during the course of the first season until finally being aired on May 13 1990 as the season finale The producers considered aborting production of the series if the next episode Bart the Genius has similar production difficulties although fortunately had several fixable animation problems They convinced FOX to postpone the season premiere for several months Although Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire the eighth episode in production order had to be aired as it was a Christmas special in December of 1989 becoming the first episode of the first season and the first episode of The Simpsons overallAlso at the end of this episode originally Marge would reveal that under her blue hair contained a pair of rabbit ears This is a clear reference to Matt Groenings comic ¨Life in Hell¨ But this ending was scraped for unknown reasons This theory made it into ¨The Simpsons Arcade Game¨ When Marge gets electrified in the game you can see rabbit ears in her hairAlthough the episode was the first produced of Season 1 and the series with its production code being 7G01 as opposed to later codes such as 7G08 from the first episode Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire production was delayed and overhauled after a workprint1 had been poorly received and covered 70 of the episode This share of the episode had to be remade and rewritten while airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire for it being a Christmas special having to air it in Christmas 1989 and becoming the first episode during this hiatus the first episode in broadcasting order and the first episode of the series instead,on a friday morning the simpson family be eat
