      "top     Homer hastily drives the Family Sedan with Marge and Maggie through a snowcovered street They are late for Bart and Lisas Christmas pageant at Springfield Elementary School After crashing into a pile of snow at the front of Springfield Elementary School park Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduce the second grade The children do a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world such as Ralph Wiggum as Hotei Oshō Dewey Largo introduces Lisa playing Tawanga the Santa Claus of the South Seas Lisa’s dance causes awe throughout the crowd Lisa performs a skilled dance with lit torches performing tricks such as throwing it around herself – Lisa also wears seethrough clothing effectively ‘revealing Lisa completely at the end of her act Skinner eventually introduces the fourth grade singing Christmas carols Jingle Bells is sung first and after the first verse Bart picks up his voice volume during the chorus and sings a Batmanthemed parody causing an irate Skinner to withdraw Bart from the performance Homer gives a disappointed look for Barts actions but as the pageant continues he grows bored and wonders aloud how long the pageant will lastAt the Simpson family home Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards as Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names and stories Marge soon stops writing due to Homers grumpy demeanor Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists Marge is uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover future costs Bart then undergoes a “James Bond”style operation Back at home Lisa tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out Marge tells him to calm down and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus further for the year Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk choosing to conceal the truth Once outside he looks at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair on the sidewalkMarge senses something is amiss with Homer and asks if there is something wrong Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping so she doesnt have to Marge agrees and is content with Homers answer the two sleep The next day Homer does the Christmas shopping alone at Circus of Values He purchases pantyhose for Marge pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie While purchasing such dismal presents Homer uses empty optimism to assure his own self On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned and Todd while he carries an armful of fancily wrapped packages All the presents are spilled onto the ground and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought Ned attempts to sort the presents unintentionally gloating his wealth At Moes Tavern Homer drinks a beer alone when a cheerful Barney arrives wearing a Santa Claus costume Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a parttime job acting as a department store Santa at the mall Homer suddenly has an idea so he goes to the personnel office in the mall where he fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa After he finishes reviewing Homers application as well as interviewing him the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues with the Hypnotist as the teacherHomer finally gets home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been Homer assures the insignificance of his tardiness and heads upstairs but Marge tells him they have guests Patty and Selma As Homer talks to Patty and Selma they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet Homer gives false information and tells them he was about to leave and he rushes out the door In the car Homer drives past several Christmas tree lots gradually the trees become cheaper from the earlier expensive ones Eventually he stops at a private Christmas Tree Farm and uses a chainsaw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family Homer is soon met with retaliation the farm owner fires his gun upon Homer and has two hounds pursue However Homer escapes relatively easily Back at home Homer stands up the tree and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma On Christmas Eve at the mall Homer works as Santa Claus while children wait in line to sit on his lap one being a very greedy child From a distance Bart Milhouse and Lewis watch the children line up to sit on Santas lap while they comment on the gullibility of the kids Milhouse dares Bart to yank off Santas beard and Bart agrees Bart jumps in line and finally gets his turn on Santas lap Not knowing that Santa is really Homer Bart yanks off his beard Bart is surprised at what he uncovers and Homer escorts Bart into Santas workshop for speaking in private leaving Alfie to cover for him Homer explains the situation to Bart who understands and feels terrible for pulling Homers beard offBart goes with Homer as he picks up his check Homer is surprised to learn that his net pay is only 13 despite his 120 gross pay When he questions the cashier she explains the majority of his check went to pay for the Santa suit and beard social security unemployment insurance training and Christmas club account balance While a depressed Homer sits down to figure out what to do with the 13 an excited Barney tells Homer that he is going to the Springfield Downs to place a bet with his earnings He invites Homer to come along with him ensuring a win on the dog Whirlwind Homer is reluctant but Bart convinces him to go citing that this might be their only chance to save the Simpson family ChristmasPatty Selma Abe Simpson Marge Maggie and Lisa wait for Homer and Bart to come home while watching a The Happy Little Elves Christmas special Meanwhile at the dog track Barney insists Homer should bet on Whirlwind After seeing what Whirlwind looks like Homer is reluctant to bet on him Just then an announcement plays over the PA system a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing Sir Galahad in the fourth race Bart senses that the announcement is an omen and chooses to ask Homer to bet on him and despite the fact that the odds are ninetynine to one which means that the dogs winning chances are extremely rare Homer puts down all 13 on Santas Little Helper Meanwhile at home Patty and Selma talk bad about Homer while everyone waits for him and Bart Lisa then explains to Patty how her bad mouthing will damage herself confusing Patty Back at the track Homer and Bart anxiously await the running of the fourth race As the race begins Homer and Bart cheer on Santas Little Helper but Whirlwind Barneys pick is out to an early lead with Santas Little Helper bringing up the rear Homer and Bart quickly realize their chances at winning any money are dashed as Santas Little Helper finishes lastHomer and Bart look for discarded betting slips hoping to find one that has been thrown away with a winner but to no avail A dejected Bart and Homer head back to their car when off in the distance they see Les a racing dog owner scolding Santas Little Helper and sending him away for losing once again Santas Little Helper leaps up into Homers arms Bart asks Homer if they can keep the dog Homer reluctant at first quickly warms up to the dog and plans to take him home Back at the Simpson home while everyone still awaits Bart and Homers return a sadlooking Homer arrives and starts to confess to everyone about the fact that he didnt receive his Christmas bonus and apologizes for the lack of presents However Bart interrupts Homer by introducing the family to Santas Little Helper and watches the hound run into the room barking Everyone ignores Homer and falls in love with Santas Little Helper Marge forgives Homer and he realizes that in the end he has

Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the episode finished thirtieth in the week of December 11–17 1989 It concluded with a Nielsen rating of 145 and was viewed in approximately 134 million homes   \n",

empty— Katara Avatar The Last Airbender to her mothers murdererSomeone delivers a speech to another character on all the reasons why that other character sucks or is a horrible person There are several contexts in which this can happen    openclose all folders      A Villain Addresses a Hero Not only has the Big Bad killed your Love Interest slain the Team Pet and finally taken over the world they must grind your selfworth into the asphalt and explain to you why you failed to stop their Evil Plan This is where they list all the reasons you are a poor excuse for a heroine and never had a prayer of stopping them you lack the skills the weapons and the powers needed you childishly fight for outdated ideals your costume is ugly and your mentor always hated youFrequently a brand of Evil Gloating andor Break Them by Talking In a welldone speech the villain will state things that the hero and audience cant argue with and when the fight is done the hero stays troubled because the Villain Has a Point However maybe theyre total BS but its delivered with such conviction it almost makes the hero and audience agree that they were wrong to have dared challenge the villain in the first placeSometimes it makes the point that the people the hero are trying to defend arent worth the trouble An especially arrogant Big Bad will use this to let the hero know theyre just a lesser version of the Big Bad himself and the only difference is theyre not saddled with morals A villain going for a lowblow might bring up some previous encounter between the two when they overpowered the hero as to state that the same thing will happen again What You Are in the Dark can and often does followMaybe the hero hurt the villain in the past or even caused their Start of Darkness maybe they abandoned them believed they were dead made them feel like theyd been replaced etc This will be what the villain addresses in this speech reminding the hero of everything theyve done to hurt them The hero might even be affected by this and have no good responseA hero worth their salt might respond with their own speech along the lines of a No More Holding Back Speech or a Picard or Kirk Summation among others If its an action movie the hero will usually say Shut Up Hannibal and then declare what and who they truly are Sometimes the hero survives only because theyre Not Worth Killing in which case theyll invariably prove that they are later in the story Often a Moment of Awesome if a Jerkass gives this to someone and they respond with a better one    A Hero Addresses a Villain Heroes can also give defeated villains The Reason You Suck Speeches often pointing out their wasted potential their callous nature and a lack of any altruistic quality or how their obsession with defeating the hero has ruined them or in the case of the WellIntentioned Extremist adversary how theyve become everything theyve fought against or how their extremes in trying to bring a better world have done more to ruin it Heroic The Reason You Suck Speeches come out when the heros not going to bother with the Kirk Summation Chances are they tried the diplomatic option and it didnt sink inA villain will usually respond by entering a Villainous Breakdown upon realizing the heros words have a grain of truth to them and being unable to stand it The WellIntentioned Extremist may acknowledge it but then state Ive Come Too Far Sometimes the villain will say Shut Up Kirk and mock them for thinking they could be swayed by mere words    A Villain Addresses Another Villain Villains can also give this to other villains on an Evil Versus Evil stage The content of this speech is usually along the lines of how theyre Eviler than Thou and pointing out flaws and shortcomings in the other villain like the Magnificent Bastard or Bitch chiding a Smug Snake a CardCarrying Villain mocking a Knight Templar for employing the same methods but believing their actions to be right and just a calculating practitioner of Pragmatic Villainy berating a Stupid Evil villain for being too sadistic to actually achieve anything or in a conflict between the Evil Genius and The Brute have the Evil Genius mock the Brute for using brute force to compensate for their low intelligence and explain their simplemindedness makes him predictable and as such easy to beat or the Brute pointing out how the Evil Genius relies on their minions and Humongous Mecha to fight their battles and for all their vaunted intelligence they cant make any of their big schemes stickAlternatively it could take the form of Even Evil Has Standards if the other villain did something they find completely unnecessary and appalling If two or more Professional Killers are hired to track down the heroes a Psycho for Hire can get this from a Hitman with a Heart who voices their disgust at the formers capacity for torture rape and enjoyment of destruction and killing or a Consummate Professional who loses patience with how their psychotic tendencies draw unwanted attention and their distaste for taking the simple approach makes the mission needlessly complicated If the Big Bad crosses the Moral Event Horizon the Noble Top Enforcer may drop one explaining how they were let down by their boss and feel betrayed by the one they looked up to before they quit A Defector from Decadence may give one against their entire country before they leave and if two villains team up to fight the heroes one of them may eventually break off their partnership with one of these as a way of establishing them as the Lighter Shade of Black Either way it can be a Moment of Awesome when the person on the receiving end has it comingThis form often doubles as a way to explain the reasoning behind a Villainous Rescue without Leaning on the Fourth Wall too hard    A Hero Addresses Another Hero Speeches from hero to hero usually come up whenever a heros Designated Hero status becomes irritating to the other protagonist or they feel that the hero being called out must be taken down a peg or more This is also occasionally done in Good Versus Good scenarios where a protagonists morality is being called into question by another protagonist who doesnt agree with their methods It usually takes place following a hero doing something particularly unheroic or if their general unpleasantness has gone past the point of acceptance Often doubles as What Were You Thinking and What the Hell Hero and in particularly bad circumstances it may cause allies to turn against one another    An AcquaintanceFriend Addresses Another AcquaintanceFriend This speech is given by someone whos just frustrated with the other person This is not an attempt to bring down or break an opponent This is not an exchange between heroes and villains heck they might even be friends This is someone tired of everything they have to deal with giving a frank and brutally honest assessment of the person theyre dealing with often in a What the Hell Hero moment This can be prone to backfire with a suitably shallow selfobsessed andor savvy target who typically responds with Youve just listed all of my best features Other times however the one who gave the speech overreacted and says that they are too harsh and its not really how they feel Will often provoke an attempted refutation or justification from the target which depending on the source can be played for comedy drama or Wangst If the target is a Designated Hero this occurrence just might motivate them to become a real hero    A Protagonist Calls Out Themselves Sometimes a protagonist in a particular shows is so filled with selfloathing that when prompted decide that theyre fed up with themselves and calls out the worst of villains themselves If done in a comedy or a Dramedy this is usually Played for Laughs However in other cases this is almost always done for drama This might be because the hero is suffering Heroic BSoD or might have implied or explicitly stated to suffer Depression This is the ultimate form of SelfDeprecation in a work Of course this could also be done to get people to sympathize with the protagonist    Someone Calls Out the Crowd The indulgences of the crowd disgusts the speaker to such an extent that they must speak out against it Calling everyone in attendance for their failures in life in a cruel but often necessary manner If it gets meta and is directed at the audience it also counts as You BastardOne thing all seven types of speech have in common is that the speaker has a point even if theyre villains To give a speech about it the speaker has to have thought it through and can usually have more than one reason why you suck This is because the writer of the story has also thought it through This is a sister trope to Calling the Old Man Out or Calling the Old Woman Out Compare Talking the Monster to Death where this is meant to kill or redeem a villain Could also be a Take That Scrappy where someone tells a hated character what the audience feels about them This can lead to failure if the character receiving the speech Cant Take Criticism Can also overlap with a Cowardice Callout which is when someone calls someone else out for fearbased shortcomingsCompare and contrast the No More Holding Back Speech which may incorporate elements of this See also Did You Actually Believe and Youre Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum An ArmorPiercing Response can provide a short but effective way of calling someone out Put to music this is The Diss Track and can become a The Villain Sucks Song or The Hero Sucks Song ForeignLanguage Tirade is quite fittingly a foreignlanguage variant of this tropeContrast Minor Insult Meltdown where just the tip of the you suck iceberg can sink someone to tears Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark See also Compassionate Critic and Constructive CriticismLastly no this isnt the trope thats about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You Finally youll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches too</td>\n",

               Just another Tuesday for Princess Peach Its time I gave you a proper thankyou Pucker up handsome— Flurrie Paper Mario The ThousandYear DoorMy hero mwahSome men quest for glory fame and riches Some men seek power and strength Some want To Be a MasterAnd some guys just want a kiss from the princess theyre trying to saveFor some strange reason princesses and other Love Interests seem to love giving out kisses as rewards for helping them The smooch of victory is a standard part of the Rescue Romance but it can appear in almost any scenario where a guy has the potential to impress a girl—either by winning a contest saving her from a horrible beast recovering her purse from thugs or whatever the plot writers think up The scenario generally goes like this Alice is in trouble Bob vows to help her Alternatively Bob is entering a contest He vows to win for Alices sake Bob overcomes obstacles goes through many trials and goes through hell and back for Alice He eventually saves Alice or reaches his goal Alice says to Bob Oh Bob How can I ever thank you Alice then proceeds to show Bob exactly how she can thank him by giving him lipstick imprints right on the face If this is Bobs first Big Damn Heroes moment it will often result in PostKiss CatatoniaMay also occur in an AfterAction PatchUp in which case she may merely acknowledge his courage first — or may berate him for stupidly getting into the matter firstUsually Bob is a Nice Guy and hes perfectly content with receiving a kiss as his reward If hes lucky he might even get a fullon makeout session with the girl he just helped If hes not well even a chaste kiss on the cheek is pretty sweet Sometimes though Bob might be a lech whos only trying to help the girl in the hopes of lockin lips with her Thus this is one of those frequently invoked tropesThe most common ways to play with this trope are to have the kissee not want the kiss for some reason and try his darndest not to get it Alternatively if he goes into the rescue or competition expecting a kiss the girl at the other end may well refuse to give him one The question of why its desired if its out of obligation and thus doesnt actually mean anything may not be addressed A growing number of examples exists where both parties are the same sex if only for the sake of a quick jokeNote that in many historical settings kissing an eligible member of the opposite sex is Serious Business it may go all the way up to being tantamount to a marriage proposalSometimes it might be unplanned or the victory coincides with the resolving of their UST When prefaced with aggression its SlapSlapKissOne of the most popular methods of Ship Teasing Can overlap with The Big Damn Kiss if Rescue Romance is involvedIf the smooch is given by a damsel after being

It This Way—is the polar opposite of Appeal to Novelty where the older position is right See also They Changed It Now It Sucks Nostalgia Filter Older Is Better Ludd Was Right Good Old Ways and New Media Are Evil This tends to be rolled out regarding consumer products and morality in the former case they dont make em like they used to and in the latter it was better in the good ol days Old ways do tend to be workable or they dont become old ways in the first place what makes this a fallacy is the unstated assumption that no better way is possible See also Culture Justifies Anything and Nobody Ever Complained Before Quite similar to Appeal to Nature Cases of They Changed It Now It Sucks often fall into this fallacy eg Character x has always had blue eyes before so changing her eyes to green is bad   \n",
       "3  I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing But now that I see you I think I understand Theres just nothing inside you Nothing at all Youre pathetic and sad and empty— Katara Avatar The Last Airbender to her mothers murdererSomeone delivers a speech to another character on all the reasons why that other character sucks or is a horrible person There are several contexts in which this can happen    openclose all folders      A Villain Addresses a Hero Not only has the Big Bad killed your Love Interest slain the Team Pet and finally taken over the world they must grind your selfworth into the asphalt and explain to you why you failed to stop their Evil Plan This is where they list all the reasons you are a poor excuse for a heroine and never had a prayer of stopping them you lack the skills the weapons and the powers needed you childishly fight for outdated ideals your costume is ugly and your mentor always hated youFrequently a brand of Evil Gloating andor Break Them by Talking In a welldone speech the villain will state things that the hero and audience cant argue with and when the fight is done the hero stays troubled because the Villain Has a Point However maybe theyre total BS but its delivered with such conviction it almost makes the hero and audience agree that they were wrong to have dared challenge the villain in the first placeSometimes it makes the point that the people the hero are trying to defend arent worth the trouble An especially arrogant Big Bad will use this to let the hero know theyre just a lesser version of the Big Bad himself and the only difference is theyre not saddled with morals A villain going for a lowblow might bring up some previous encounter between the two when they overpowered the hero as to state that the same thing will happen again What You Are in the Dark can and often does followMaybe the hero hurt the villain in the past or even caused their Start of Darkness maybe they abandoned them believed they were dead made them feel like theyd been replaced etc This will be what the villain addresses in this speech reminding the hero of everything theyve done to hurt them The hero might even be affected by this and have no good responseA hero worth their salt might respond with their own speech along the lines of a No More Holding Back Speech or a Picard or Kirk Summation among others If its an action movie the hero will usually say Shut Up Hannibal and then declare what and who they truly are Sometimes the hero survives only because theyre Not Worth Killing in which case theyll invariably prove that they are later in the story Often a Moment of Awesome if a Jerkass gives this to someone and they respond with a better one    A Hero Addresses a Villain Heroes can also give defeated villains The Reason You Suck Speeches often pointing out their wasted potential their callous nature and a lack of any altruistic quality or how their obsession with defeating the hero has ruined them or in the case of the WellIntentioned Extremist adversary how theyve become everything theyve fought against or how their extremes in trying to bring a better world have done more to ruin it Heroic The Reason You Suck Speeches come out when the heros not going to bother with the Kirk Summation Chances are they tried the diplomatic option and it didnt sink inA villain will usually respond by entering a Villainous Breakdown upon realizing the heros words have a grain of truth to them and being unable to stand it The WellIntentioned Extremist may acknowledge it but then state Ive Come Too Far Sometimes the villain will say Shut Up Kirk and mock them for thinking they could be swayed by mere words    A Villain Addresses Another Villain Villains can also give this to other villains on an Evil Versus Evil stage The content of this speech is usually along the lines of how theyre Eviler than Thou and pointing out flaws and shortcomings in the other villain like the Magnificent Bastard or Bitch chiding a Smug Snake a CardCarrying Villain mocking a Knight Templar for employing the same methods but believing their actions to be right and just a calculating practitioner of Pragmatic Villainy berating a Stupid Evil villain for being too sadistic to actually achieve anything or in a conflict between the Evil Genius and The Brute have the Evil Genius mock the Brute for using brute force to compensate for their low intelligence and explain their simplemindedness makes him predictable and as such easy to beat or the Brute pointing out how the Evil Genius relies on their minions and Humongous Mecha to fight their battles and for all their vaunted intelligence they cant make any of their big schemes stickAlternatively it could take the form of Even Evil Has Standards if the other villain did something they find completely unnecessary and appalling If two or more Professional Killers are hired to track down the heroes a Psycho for Hire can get this from a Hitman with a Heart who voices their disgust at the formers capacity for torture rape and enjoyment of destruction and killing or a Consummate Professional who loses patience with how their psychotic tendencies draw unwanted attention and their distaste for taking the simple approach makes the mission needlessly complicated If the Big Bad crosses the Moral Event Horizon the Noble Top Enforcer may drop one explaining how they were let down by their boss and feel betrayed by the one they looked up to before they quit A Defector from Decadence may give one against their entire country before they leave and if two villains team up to fight the heroes one of them may eventually break off their partnership with one of these as a way of establishing them as the Lighter Shade of Black Either way it can be a Moment of Awesome when the person on the receiving end has it comingThis form often doubles as a way to explain the reasoning behind a Villainous Rescue without Leaning on the Fourth Wall too hard    A Hero Addresses Another Hero Speeches from hero to hero usually come up whenever a heros Designated Hero status becomes irritating to the other protagonist or they feel that the hero being called out must be taken down a peg or more This is also occasionally done in Good Versus Good scenarios where a protagonists morality is being called into question by another protagonist who doesnt agree with their methods It usually takes place following a hero doing something particularly unheroic or if their general unpleasantness has gone past the point of acceptance Often doubles as What Were You Thinking and What the Hell Hero and in particularly bad circumstances it may cause allies to turn against one another    An AcquaintanceFriend Addresses Another AcquaintanceFriend This speech is given by someone whos just frustrated with the other person This is not an attempt to bring down or break an opponent This is not an exchange between heroes and villains heck they might even be friends This is someone tired of everything they have to deal with giving a frank and brutally honest assessment of the person theyre dealing with often in a What the Hell Hero moment This can be prone to backfire with a suitably shallow selfobsessed andor savvy target who typically responds with Youve just listed all of my best features Other times however the one who gave the speech overreacted and says that they are too harsh and its not really how they feel Will often provoke an attempted refutation or justification from the target which depending on the source can be played for comedy drama or Wangst If the target is a Designated Hero this occurrence just might motivate them to become a real hero    A Protagonist Calls Out Themselves Sometimes a protagonist in a particular shows is so filled with selfloathing that when prompted decide that theyre fed up with themselves and calls out the worst of villains themselves If done in a comedy or a Dramedy this is usually Played for Laughs However in other cases this is almost always done for drama This might be because the hero is suffering Heroic BSoD or might have implied or explicitly stated to suffer Depression This is the ultimate form of SelfDeprecation in a work Of course this could also be done to get people to sympathize with the protagonist    Someone Calls Out the Crowd The indulgences of the crowd disgusts the speaker to such an extent that they must speak out against it Calling everyone in attendance for their failures in life in a cruel but often necessary manner If it gets meta and is directed at the audience it also counts as You BastardOne thing all seven types of speech have in common is that the speaker has a point even if theyre villains To give a speech about it the speaker has to have thought it through and can usually have more than one reason why you suck This is because the writer of the story has also thought it through This is a sister trope to Calling the Old Man Out or Calling the Old Woman Out Compare Talking the Monster to Death where this is meant to kill or redeem a villain Could also be a Take That Scrappy where someone tells a hated character what the audience feels about them This can lead to failure if the character receiving the speech Cant Take Criticism Can also overlap with a Cowardice Callout which is when someone calls someone else out for fearbased shortcomingsCompare and contrast the No More Holding Back Speech which may incorporate elements of this See also Did You Actually Believe and Youre Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum An ArmorPiercing Response can provide a short but effective way of calling someone out Put to music this is The Diss Track and can become a The Villain Sucks Song or The Hero Sucks Song ForeignLanguage Tirade is quite fittingly a foreignlanguage variant of this tropeContrast Minor Insult Meltdown where just the tip of the you suck iceberg can sink someone to tears Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark See also Compassionate Critic and Constructive CriticismLastly no this isnt the trope thats about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You Finally youll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches too   \n",

                            Its very sweet until you realize how many hidden cameras he had to set up to get all this— Bill Corbett Batman  Robin RiffTraxIn many situations where someone watches a recording of an event that the audience has already seen happening the recording will — by the purest coincidence — happen to use exactly the same footage that the audience has already witnessed That is to say it will include all the same dramatic camera angles pans and zooms as the original scene despite that theres no way an inuniverse device especially a stationary device like a fixed security camera could have captured and produced such well cinematic footageEven if not recycled footage there are other elements used to produce a similar results including Perfect composition especially notable on a panning camera keeping perfect pace with the subject They are rarely standing in the upper right corner of the screen with their back turned Cinematic angles as most security cameras are stationed near the ceiling looking down not making it very effective in showing a closeup of an actor Even the footage of an InUniverse camcorder using Jitter Cam can make you wonder why the subjects arent aware they are being recorded Dynamic editing letting us jump in at the best part Especially helpful with paring down the footage from multiple cameras as even just a splitscreen means someone had to sync it up Image resolution and sound quality on par with nonsecurity cam footage Even in the modern era of 4K cameras many security cameras used today still produce lowresolution images that can even make it difficult to make out facial detail Smooth continuous video A camera that continuously records and saves high resolution high frame rate video will run out of storage space in short order Even today security cameras tend to have very low frame rates you only need a few frames per second to be able to at least tell what is going on and often only save footage when movement is detectedSometimes this is Hand Waved by overlaying visual effects on the recording — conversion to blackandwhite simulated scanning lines a datetime stamp or watermark meaningless computerese advanced technology where cameras can be anywhere and so on this still doesnt change the fact that the movie isnt attempting to recreate the scene as it would actually appear to the inuniverse device This is only averted in science fiction settings where the footage is often a holographic recording instead allowing the characters to directly observe the incidentSee also Magical Computer Caught on Tape Compare Surveillance as the Plot Demands where the footage is equally implausible but due to location How did they get a camera on the moon and not necessarily the angles For security cams that are actually magical see Magical Camera   \n",

of both A and B When Shao Kahn arrives to merge his realm with Earth out of the surviving four heroes only Raiden remains Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade are too beaten to stand up to Shao Kahn and are

also be considered B as at this point Raidens faith that the elder gods will do anything to help the Earth is more or less gone and he could be simply trying to hand over the Earth to Shao Kahn

off because he cant believe his rival capitulated so easily but cant tell whether or not hes mocking him or being completely serious about it Under somewhat similar circumstances this is also done in Suikoden II when Apple gets on her knees and begs Shu to join your cause when realises that she alone cannot act as the army strategist You have the option of telling her not to or joining her in a Pose of Supplication Whichever option you choose it really pisses Shu off and he kicks you out of his house Early in Tales of the Abyss Colonel Badass Jade kneels down to humbly beg Luke for his

Do we really need to tell you that this guys not the heroWhat monstrosities would walk the streets were some peoples faces as unfinished as their minds—Eric Hoffer Reflections on the Human Condition 1973There are heroes and then there are villains And the audience needs to know which is which even before anyone gets to Kick the Dog or Pet the Dog or does anything involving the metaphorical dog The hero in order to be properly heroic will be handsome possibly to a sickening degree The villain may be goodlooking as well but if they are they will often have some type of physical defect or tipoff to their monstrous naturePeople sympathize less with others who have a physical defect This is in essence a deliberate invocation of that using the minor defect to provoke a negative audience responseIts often a Mark of the Supernatural resulting in a Glamour Failure that can be used to spot a creatures true nature even if its a Voluntary Shapeshifter Monstrous examples take the form of a Mark of the Beast often including Fangs Are Evil Femme Fatalons Creepy Asymmetry andor Horns of VillainyHowever sometimes the trope is deconstructed to show that the character didnt start out evil but became evil because of being bullied or mocked for the deformity in questionThe phrase originally comes from Horace a reference to Jupiters wrath English Renaissance icon John Miltons translation of the term rubente dextra in Horaces Ode i223 The famous work Paradise Lost written by Milton repopularized the phrase for modern Englishspeaking audiences The quote in Paradise Lost Book II 170174 is as followsWhat if the breath that kindled those grim fires Awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the flames or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague usMakes up the evil scars of the Good Scars Evil Scars duo Related to Scary Shiny Glasses and Hypnotic Eyes Since Evil Is Cool a Red Right Hand may occasionally overlap with Fashionable Asymmetry andor The Right Hand of Doom If the deformity also comes with labored breathing or a cough its Vader Breath If this appearance carries discolored veins its Tainted Veins A WhiteHaired Pretty Boy the undeathly pale will typically fall under this category When its a trait retained from shapeshifting from another form see also Morphic Resonance Contrast The Grotesque whose outer deformity hides inner goodness although Grotesques may occasionally be given a Red Right Hand usually symbolic of their struggle against inner evil or madness Often results when someone Came Back Wrong Contrast with Hidden Evil If a group of villains have the same red right hand see GroupIdentifying FeatureWith the increasing visibility of the disability rights movement theres increased awareness of the Unfortunate Implications this can have and some versions are on their way to becoming Discredited Tropes For example in 2018 the British Film Institute announced that it would no longer fund movies

vice pays to virtue— La RochefoucauldPeople — particularly those with authority be it moral or political — are expected to act in accordance with the ideals they espouse That is to say they should practice what they preachThose who dont are hypocrites The dichotomy here is that they may fervently and honestly believe what they say is right and good they just dont have the moral strength or willpower to consistently live up to their own high standards Unless of course theyre outright liars with no intention of living up to said standards They might believe that Utopia Justifies the Means and that they arent worthy of it  or that only they can be entrusted to use those means because theyre so enlightened ie better than everyone else Maybe theyre deeply in denial or have a severe lack of selfawareness and justify their hypocrisy as either necessary or dismiss it with a simple Thats different In other cases they might find the lure of Forbidden Fruit impossible to resist Or maybe they think the rules should only apply to othersFrequently they will be found out be it in an Engineered Public Confession or through investigation The Hero may have the choice of either exposing them as a fraud and discrediting them before their followers or keeping their secret and blackmailing them into cleaning up their act or helping in another matter How this turns out depends on how sympathetic or Jerkassic they are and how humanizing their vice is whether it be a diet guru eating donuts probably OK an ecobusinessman clearcutting forests probably not OK or a moral crusader outright molesting children most certainly not OK If a villain finds a friend of the heros Fatal Flaw this way or worse the heros own they might use Flaw Exploitation to torment and control themIf found out andor exposed the hypocrite will have the chance to mend their ways and do a HeelFace Turn in one of two forms either loosen their standards and cut everyone else the same slack they give themselves or tighten their belt and actually live up to their espoused ideals Failure to do either is usually enough for either a mental breakdown heroic or villainous depending on the character or a fullon FaceHeel Turn as they reject their morality and embrace their vice Alternatively because they are feigning what they claim to be they may find they are Becoming the MaskHeroes are often accused of hypocrisy by villains who want to believe theyre not that different and brag At Least I Admit It Heroes who actually are hypocrites tend to hear What the Hell Hero quite a lot Unless they dont Hypocrites be they heroes or villains often find themselves hated by the audience intentionally or not even more than the CardCarrying Villain chiefly because they lied about their convictions while those evil villains come off as being pretty honest in what they do This is usually because of the Holier Than Thou implications that someone who publicly preaches about good things is signaling to other people that they are a good person or are at least better than some others and people feel cheated when that does not end up being the case Treachery Is a Special Kind of Evil after all and a Hypocrites actions betray their words preaching and supposedly good proposals Remember also however that the Hypocrite Has a Point just because someone is being hypocritical does not also mean that they are wrongAn Entitled Bastard is often guilty of hypocrisy because of their inflated sense of selfimportance they genuinely believe that they are deserving of gratitude respect love etc from others even if they treat others with no such dignity which is often the case They will disregard the rights of others without shame yet be genuinely offended at how unfair it is for those same people to not like themHowever like mentioned above its possible to be hypocritical and a good person at the same time whether that would be a Jerk with a Heart of Gold or a fullblown Nice Guy and it depends on how severe the hypocrisy is and the hypocrites level of selfawareness This in return is what makes hypocrisy mainly considered to be a minor form of jerkassery by defaultIt depends on whether this is intentional or not One writer would do this intentionally so the character would go through a Jerkass Realization Hypocritical Humor is a minor degree of this when Played for Laughs Another writer may make a character or do something but then forgot about it later on then making them do things that contrast with earlier claims It usually takes fans or other writers to point them out and its up

Hearts Super Mario World 2 Yoshis Island and Assassination Classroommaking the moon fucked up is the first step of any good worldbuilding the moon is normal in your story just a normal moon amateur mistake— Shen TwitterThe Moon Our planets only natural companion the brightest object in the night sky worshipped as a deity by countless cultures inspiration of poets lovers lunatics and werewolvesDepictions of the moon in fiction vary and it can behave rather  oddlySize and shape The crescent moon is often depicted in a stylized unrealistic manner with the horns of the crescent extending an average of threequarters of a circle In Real Life they always end at opposite ends of a diameter Likewise the inner dark part of the crescent is often circular in shape which in Real Life only occurs if something eclipses the moon The crescent can sometimes point incorrectly for the hemisphere its observed from ie contrary to the position of the sun Sometimes as seen in the picture above it may actually be a hollowed crescent shape to begin with There can be objects such as stars visible inside the crescent in Real Life this can only occur if theres something on the moons surface emitting light or if something else is between the moon and viewer Or you know if something shot a huge chunk out of it If the characters actually realize this it usually becomes an important plot pointLunar phases The moon is never shown during its gibbous more than halffull phase and rarely shown in its half phase — its always either a crescent moon or full moon The only times these other phases are shown is if the lunar cycle plays an actual role in the setting eg a gameplay mechanic in Video Games and even then these other phases are little more than leadup to the next full moon The tips of the crescent moon are often seen pointing down In Real Life this happens only during daytime The phase may change noticeably within a single night and without the equally dramatic change in position that this would normally requireEclipses and phenomena The lunar phase affects peoples moods way more than is really likely Presuming the moon and the atmosphere are even vaguely like Earths no part of the moon can be darker than the surrounding sky The sky is lightblueinfrontofblackspace therefore even the blackest parts of the moon will be lightblueinfrontofblackmoonSubtropes Bad Moon Rising The moon looks weird because bad things are going to happen Cheesy Moon The moon is made of cheese Deface of the Moon The moon has actually been physically altered to change its appearance Gigantic Moon The moon appears larger in the sky than it really is The Man in the Moon The moon has a face on it Moon Rabbit The moon has a rabbit on itFor

toss him in a bucket of acid Marge Oh dear Meyers But then we remembered that this might be interpreted as violence which is morally wrong now thanks to you So whats your big idea How do we end this Marge Hrmmm Lets see Oh Couldnt Itchy share his pie with Scratchy Then they would both have pie Meyers Its different Ill give you that— The Simpsons Itchy  Scratchy  MargeThe light twin of Darker and Edgier when something is Tone Shifted to be more family friendly and frothy than the original source This can either happen to a show over time or it can be the result of deliberate Executive Meddling It could be a deliberate throwback to a preCerebus Syndrome incarnation Thus a Lighter And Softer reboot may often follow an incarnation which made a point of being Darker and Edgier Finally if an adult or more serious TV show or movie has a spinoff aimed at children this can be the result Just like its brother extreme Lighter and Softer can leave just as bad of a taste in longtime fans mouths as Darker and Edgier if handled poorlyAt its most extreme it can turn a previously vibrant cast into Flat Characters and remove a lot of the shows appeal or even cause fans to abandon the work entirely If it shoehorns BlackandWhite Morality into the work and makes everyone clear heroes and villains then expect people to complain about the loss of subtlety in the setting or feel like the writers are talking down to themIn music this may result in an artist merely recording a Surprisingly Gentle Song or it could lead to the artist having a complete Genre Shift to a lighter genreOften found alongside Denser and Wackier when the work is made sillier and more gagoriented than what came before Younger and Hipper retooling a work so that the characters are younger to appeal to younger demographics and Kinder and Cleaner where profanity is toned down if not removed outright Also often signaled by an increase in wacky humorJust like with Darker and Edgier please keep in mind that Tropes Are Tools When something is lighter and softer than its initial source material it doesnt mean its automatically worse It usually depends on who createswrites said material as well as how subtly they make the transition Executive Meddling may of course be at fault We gotta appeal to the kids But other reasons include trying to be more mainstream to change an unpopular run to appeal to another demographic to recognize and dispel Too Bleak Stopped Caring etc The Lighter And Softer run can end up being positively remembered for years to come It just depends on whos behind the product and how they execute itCompare Bowdlerise where a work is edited to remove material that can be considered questionable Disneyfication making a story more suitable for children by toning down the darker elements Menace Decay where a bratty child character becomes less of a troublemaker over time Badass Decay where audiences see a cool character as becoming not as impressive and formidable as they used to be Reverse Cerebus Syndrome where an initially dark work becomes lighter in tone over time WAFF when a works whole purpose is to appeal to the audience by being cute and endearing Adaptational Angst Downgrade where an adaptation changes a characters backstory to remove the tragic parts Tamer and Chaster where a work reduces the amount of nudity and sexual content and Pacified Adaptation where the adaptation has less violence   \n",

am awesomely wondrously made Your work is wonderful I know it very well My frame was not concealed from You when I was shaped in a hidden place knit together in the recesses of the earth Your eyes saw my unformed limbs they were all recorded in Your book in due time they were formed to the very last one of them— Psalm 1391416 The Biblebecause everyone else is takenBe Yourself is a popular trope especially in shows aimed at children One character tries to persuade another character to change their image and not be a loser geek etc After the change goes amiss Flowers for Algernon Syndrome almost always ensues and An Aesop is delivered about how it is better to be true to ones own nature rather than putting on a facade to impress others Usually that means being behind the times unfashionable out of shape handicapped overweight uncool a complete and utter failure socially inept and that especially means being that guy Being oneself also requires a person to live below his or her full potential Its one of the most frequently broken Aesops tying in to the Status Quo Is God mindsetIf this trope is played well it can carry the message that you can be worthy of love and acceptance without sacrificing the things that make you who you are and to value your unique traits rather than hide them to fit in but if done poorly or too often the message can imply that any kind of personal growth and self improvement are bad and you must never try a new look pick up new interests or make new friends Or worse that you should be a Jerkass rather than work to become a better person Bonus points if a Subculture of the Week is featured to try to sway our hero to their sideThe Easily Embarrassed Youngster often learns this one If the trope succeeds it may lead to said

nachos in a rare double example of this trope Batman The Brave and the BoldAs any writer will tell you there are times when drama art and normal human behavior are not just at odds but in a Mexican Standoff waiting for the others to blink before blasting each other as doves flutter by in slow motionSometimes the characters are stuck and unable to move forward and the author doesnt feel comfortable dropping in solutions via Deus ex Machina or having a guy barge in with a gun Other times theres a great set up for a joke but no one present is snarky or smart enough to say it There is a solution it simply requires that one or more characters act outside their established character for just a momentEnter the OutofCharacter Moment Whether its one of the various Ball Tropes Contrived Stupidity Tropes Improbable Behavior Tropes or Poor Communication Kills a character gets Character Derailment for a scene and allows the plot to move in the direction the author wants Generally the creator themselves will acknowledge they forced their characters behavior in some way though its not quite as damaging as Character Derailment especially when it results in the natural progression of the plotIf this happens in a comedic situation especially if the character is being nicer or more responsible than usual another character is likely to lampshade it by asking Who are you and what have you done with XQuite often it is a very fine line and difficult to notice in the first place such as the difference between a Deadpan Snarker and The Comically Serious At other times with a FiveMan Band or other ensemble group characters they are often shifted around to better fit into a team dynamic when they are used to being alone or in a simple partnershipSpeaking of natural growth this OutofCharacter Moment may be expanded on as Character Development for examples of this see OOC Is Serious Business If they are being pushed beyond their comfort zone they may act differently than normal but somehow they find their own way to survive After all not all character growth is predictable or linearThis can be Truth in Television real people will not always behave in the most expected way and indeed it is unrealistic to expect a fictional character to behave any more consistently Depending on the general circumstances immediate situation and who is around the mildest individual can just snap This is related to the Fundamental Attribution Error in which people tend to place more of what they expect from someone on their personality than the situationAnd this is also a reminder that true Character Derailment isnt merely one instance of I dont like what they didHowever said character may tell hisher peers not to get used to it as heshe may intend on making said characterbreaking moment a onetime thingContrast Alternative Character Interpretation See also Character Exaggeration and Characterization Marches On Possibly caused by a Writer on BoardCan be considered a SuperTrope to pretty much the entire Ball Index   \n",
