      "top     Homer hastily drives the Family Sedan with Marge and Maggie through a snowcovered street They are late for Bart and Lisas Christmas pageant at Springfield Elementary School After crashing into a pile of snow at the front of Springfield Elementary School park Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduce the second grade The children do a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world such as Ralph Wiggum as Hotei Oshō Dewey Largo introduces Lisa playing Tawanga the Santa Claus of the South Seas Lisa’s dance causes awe throughout the crowd Lisa performs a skilled dance with lit torches performing tricks such as throwing it around herself – Lisa also wears seethrough clothing effectively ‘revealing Lisa completely at the end of her act Skinner eventually introduces the fourth grade singing Christmas carols Jingle Bells is sung first and after the first verse Bart picks up his voice volume during the chorus and sings a Batmanthemed parody causing an irate Skinner to withdraw Bart from the performance Homer gives a disappointed look for Barts actions but as the pageant continues he grows bored and wonders aloud how long the pageant will lastAt the Simpson family home Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards as Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names and stories Marge soon stops writing due to Homers grumpy demeanor Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists Marge is uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover future costs Bart then undergoes a “James Bond”style operation Back at home Lisa tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out Marge tells him to calm down and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus further for the year Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk choosing to conceal the truth Once outside he looks at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair on the sidewalkMarge senses something is amiss with Homer and asks if there is something wrong Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping so she doesnt have to Marge agrees and is content with Homers answer the two sleep The next day Homer does the Christmas shopping alone at Circus of Values He purchases pantyhose for Marge pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie While purchasing such dismal presents Homer uses empty optimism to assure his own self On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned and Todd while he carries an armful of fancily wrapped packages All the presents are spilled onto the ground and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought Ned attempts to sort the presents unintentionally gloating his wealth At Moes Tavern Homer drinks a beer alone when a cheerful Barney arrives wearing a Santa Claus costume Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a parttime job acting as a department store Santa at the mall Homer suddenly has an idea so he goes to the personnel office in the mall where he fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa After he finishes reviewing Homers application as well as interviewing him the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues with the Hypnotist as the teacherHomer finally gets home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been Homer assures the insignificance of his tardiness and heads upstairs but Marge tells him they have guests Patty and Selma As Homer talks to Patty and Selma they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet Homer gives false information and tells them he was about to leave and he rushes out the door In the car Homer drives past several Christmas tree lots gradually the trees become cheaper from the earlier expensive ones Eventually he stops at a private Christmas Tree Farm and uses a chainsaw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family Homer is soon met with retaliation the farm owner fires his gun upon Homer and has two hounds pursue However Homer escapes relatively easily Back at home Homer stands up the tree and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma On Christmas Eve at the mall Homer works as Santa Claus while children wait in line to sit on his lap one being a very greedy child From a distance Bart Milhouse and Lewis watch the children line up to sit on Santas lap while they comment on the gullibility of the kids Milhouse dares Bart to yank off Santas beard and Bart agrees Bart jumps in line and finally gets his turn on Santas lap Not knowing that Santa is really Homer Bart yanks off his beard Bart is surprised at what he uncovers and Homer escorts Bart into Santas workshop for speaking in private leaving Alfie to cover for him Homer explains the situation to Bart who understands and feels terrible for pulling Homers beard offBart goes with Homer as he picks up his check Homer is surprised to learn that his net pay is only 13 despite his 120 gross pay When he questions the cashier she explains the majority of his check went to pay for the Santa suit and beard social security unemployment

place a bet with his earnings He invites Homer to come along with him ensuring a win on the dog Whirlwind Homer is reluctant but Bart convinces him to go citing that this might be their only chance to save the Simpson family ChristmasPatty Selma Abe Simpson Marge Maggie and Lisa wait for Homer and Bart to come home while watching a The Happy Little Elves Christmas special Meanwhile at the dog track Barney insists Homer should bet on Whirlwind After seeing what Whirlwind looks like Homer is reluctant to bet on him Just then an announcement plays over the PA system a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing Sir Galahad in the fourth race Bart senses that the announcement is an omen and chooses to ask Homer to bet on him and despite the fact that the odds are ninetynine to one which means that the dogs winning chances are extremely rare Homer puts down all 13 on Santas Little Helper Meanwhile at home Patty and Selma talk bad about Homer while everyone waits for him and Bart Lisa then explains to Patty how her bad mouthing will damage herself confusing Patty Back at the track Homer and Bart anxiously await the running of the fourth race As the race begins Homer and Bart cheer on Santas Little Helper but Whirlwind Barneys pick is out to an early lead with Santas Little Helper bringing up the rear Homer and Bart quickly realize their chances at winning any money are dashed

Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the episode finished thirtieth in the week of December 11–17 1989 It concluded with a Nielsen rating of 145 and was viewed in approximately 134 million homes   \n",

caused harm to the innocent But when the time comes for the hammer to fall thats not what happens At least not on them They dont get what they deserve Instead they get away scotfree They are Easily Forgiven maybe even praised and even elected president And they might even have reversed the Humiliation Conga that was being planned for them Worst comes to worst The Bad Guy Wins and a stolen happy

isnt going to write any more The Word of God has been spoken Karma is out to lunch The villain has become a Karma HoudiniPredictably it is often shocking or downright upsetting to see such scoundrels dodge instant karmic punishment and come out triumphant in the end But as frustrating as it is it does not necessarily make the story worse as long as it doesnt feel forced contrived or even shortsighted Regardless this trope runs the high risk of leaving the audiences thirst for emotional catharsis unsatiated especially when theyve become so invested in seeing the villain theyve projected their hate onto get their full commupance that may or may not come by the end And when it doesnt you can expect them to complain about it and clamor for a sequel where the villain does get their comeuppance — or alternatively theyll try to satisfy their frustratingly unfulfilled desire for retribution by writing their ownThere can be a number of reasons for this trope Sometimes the story is going for a Downer Ending in which the villains escape justice for their crimes Other times the creators overlook relatively minor offenders whether due to not considering their actions worthy of punishment or not having the time to see them get their comeuppance within the story Still other times it may not be possible to exact retribution on the characters who ends up becoming Karma Houdinis It could be that theyre too powerful to be subject to retribution any Eldritch Abomination in a horror story is likely to be this as even if they dont outright win they are so beyond mortal comprehension that the best the protagonists can hope for is to simply escape them Or it could be that theres no way to legally judge them because they are above the law in some way and the protagonists are not willing to risk it all for some vigilante justiceCompare ButtMonkey for which a character ends up having many disproportionately bad things happen to them throughout the story and may also technically qualify for this trope as hard as that sounds The extreme counterpart of the former trope Cosmic Plaything can be considered this tropes polar opposite Also compare with No Good

and is directly traceable to their transgression Karma Houdini Warranty when the comeuppance only happens in a sequel and Karmic Death when the comeuppance leads to the villains death Also see Idiot Houdini when a person is forever protected from the results of their stupidityNote that a character doesnt necessarily need to be a fulltime villain to qualify for this trope They may simply end up doing unnecessarily hurtful things yet not suffer the repercussions In contrast when someone is too evil to kill off but may suffer other consequences see Joker ImmunityNote also The work usually must be completed for a character to qualify as this trope Only if there are no more opportunities for LaserGuided Karma to strike can a character be said to have successfully avoided any consequences for their actions Exceptions may be made in cases where Status Quo Is Godnote which is why you should not add this trope to the This Image Is Not an Example index or when a character can be said to have permanently escaped eg they died peacefully in their sleep at an old age And sometimes even thats not enough Unless they somehow managed to get into Heaven and are gleefully rubbing their current state in your face Otherwise resist the urge to put it on an ongoing works pageDont mistake a lack of direct karma for this trope If a character for example murders someone and never gets caught but a

French Maid Outfit Cut to Bobs face — hes clearly just imagined the role and Alice has just slapped him to wake him up back to realityA very popular trope with commercials so much so that it could

this spot— Garfield Garfield and Friends Arbuckle the InvincibleThe Monster Who Couldnt Scare AnybodyThe Ocean BlueA trope throughout a series by which a part of the opening or ending credits is interchangeably switched and the content can be different every show Some of the same shows also have couch gags at the end as a Credits Gag Alternatively this gag may occur at the end of The Teaser just before the credits startNamed for one of its bestknown incarnations the family scrambling to gather on the couch during the opening sequence of The SimpsonsNote that it need not be a gag TV dramas such as Mission Impossible and Justice League Unlimited will sometimes have clips from later in the episodeCompare to Different in Every Episode Not to be confused with the other type of couch

Its a running gag nowKermit the Frog No Fozzie Do not answer that telephone Fozzie Bear But Kermit all these terrific funny things happen when I do answer it Kermit Im aware of that Im aware of that Fozzie Is there no end to this running gag Animal runs in and rips the phone off the wall before carrying it away Fozzie Well I guess that puts an end to this running gag Kermit Yeah and also to all the incoming calls— The Muppet ShowA joke whose humor derives from repetition ideally becoming funnier each time it is repeated Must be repeated at least three times otherwise its a Brick Joke or Chekhovs Gag Common variants are a joke that occurs Once an Episode and a joke that goes on for long enough that it becomes an OverlyLong Gag but not so long that it loses its humorThe ultimate fear for the use of any running gag is that doing it too often threatens to turn it into an Overused Running Gag or worse it was never funny in the first place and didnt improve through repetition Nothing is worse than starting a one hour show with a joke that bombs the first time and reappears twenty more times over the next hourA Running Gag can be limited to a particular episode or recur throughout an entire series If it recurs throughout an entire series then it will often develop variations andor be accompanied by Lampshade Hanging If a character breaks the fourth wall to mention it its Didnt We Use This Joke Already When the story goes on to kill off the gag for good either with a final payoff or just by referencing that its become too overused and its ending right then that is Running

dish best served with an extra helping— Captain Young Troops of DoomIn some situations it makes sense to let the opponent know that if they so much as sneeze on someone you protect it will cost them a limb If you have tried an eye for an eye and it really didnt do anything except help sell eyepatches the only way to stay alive is to be drastic Pay back any offense tenfold or even a hundredfold if necessary until the survivors learn to stay away andor do everything in their power to keep you in a good mood Its a common tactic of militaries the world over with some regimes such as Nazi Germany being infamous for itThat said the Justice these rivals have in mind is more akin to a brutal beatdown well most of the time it is an actual brutal NoHoldsBarred Beatdown supposed to culminate in the receivers humiliation or death Any attempt to get them to see the all too obvious truth show mercy or realize theyre a step away from utterly ruining the receivers lifecommitting murder will never succeed It invariably takes the hero beating the rival be it in a Cooking Duel or Good Old Fisticuffs and proving Right Makes Might for the poor deluded soul to realize they were wrong all along sometimes even coming around and realizing that Defeat Means FriendshipVillains who claim that their bad pastcircumstances led them to do this will likely make you realize that Freudian Excuse Is No ExcuseAll too often these guys refuse to see reason They promise that theyll come back to kill the hero and shove his mercy and offer of friendship down his wind pipe It might take the arrival of a plot significant character to clear things up and hand out some Epiphany Therapy to all involvedThis is not limited to the antagonists side God help you if that hero youve harmed has a Psycho Supporter And all parties to a masquerade good or bad are often required to kill any poor schmuck who accidentally sees something hes not supposed toThis could be what stops something from being an act of justice instead of an act of vengeance May be used as part of Cruel Mercy A common habit for Lawful Stupid charactersIntriguingly while disproportionate can possibly mean underdoing it youll almost never see that happen   \n",

     In just a handful of scenes weve established the full set of character archetypes to see us through until the series goes off air Zacks a huckster Slater a jock Jessie an uptight brain Kelly a cheerful object of desire and Screech an intolerable bundle of silly faces When Lisa appears on crutches having kicked a television in rage when her favorite nail polish was discontinued her core personality — likes clothes doesnt fancy Screech — is also laid out— Stuart Millard on the first episode of Saved by the BellFirst impressions count and in TV and film even more so theres no point in hiring an actor to give us a Deadpan Snarker if people think theyre seriously being a total ditz until the third act So when the character comes into the plot you give them an Establishing Character MomentThe establishing character moment does not have to be huge it doesnt have to be impressive it doesnt even have to be first Its about revealing a characters motivations and abilities in a single introductory scene They could blow the roof and rappel in from a helicopter with an automatic in each hand but if theyre The Woobie its not a good idea unless youre aiming for a Heartbroken Badass like Harry Dresden or SpiderManSometimes the first thing needed is to set up how they fit into the plot but this may not best reveal their character So the Establishing Character Moment may be one or two scenes down the line For TV shows and their episodic format the character may first do what they need to do in the episode and then near the end establish how the character will fit into the ongoing arcs and themes of the showOther times the Moment may be the small calm when the character carries out something completely unrelated to the plot to show them in their natural element before putting them in an unrelenting storm of plot lines — for instance during a Morning Routine sequenceWhen it happens it cannot be taken back A running punt to a puppy will completely color attempts to Pet the Dog later but if you start with a gentle stroke then some people may get the wrong idea about your villain Then again a Bait the Dog moment may subvert this or it might itself serve to show the complex multifaceted Hidden Depths of that characterIf this happens in a musical it can be in I Am Song formatSubtropes include BaitandSwitch Character Intro Bitch Alert Incoming Ham Newcomer

       "7  So is Satan just generous when people dont have a soul to sell Maybe if you do enough deeds in his nameIts hard to be religious when certain people are never incinerated by bolts of lightning— Calvin about Moe Calvin and HobbesSometimes even LaserGuided Karma misses its targetThe character has done a number of things that deserve a karmic comeuppance most importantly things that caused harm to the innocent But when the time comes for the hammer to fall thats not what happens At least not on them They dont get what they deserve Instead they get away scotfree They are Easily Forgiven maybe even praised and even elected president And they might even have reversed the Humiliation Conga that was being planned for them Worst comes to worst The Bad Guy Wins and a stolen happy ending takes place at the expense of the hapless victim who may be punished in the guilty characters placeThis is it This is all there is to the story The show is over The book is finished The author isnt going to write any more The Word of God has been spoken Karma is out to lunch The villain has become a Karma HoudiniPredictably it is often shocking or downright upsetting to see such scoundrels dodge instant karmic punishment and come out triumphant in the end But as frustrating as it is it does not necessarily make the story worse as long as it doesnt feel forced contrived or even shortsighted Regardless this trope runs the high risk of leaving the audiences thirst for emotional catharsis unsatiated especially when theyve become so invested in seeing the villain theyve projected their hate onto get their full commupance that may or may not come by the end And when it doesnt you can expect them to complain about it and clamor for a sequel where the villain does get their comeuppance — or alternatively theyll try to satisfy their frustratingly unfulfilled desire for retribution by writing their ownThere can be a number of reasons for this trope Sometimes the story is going for a Downer Ending in which the villains escape justice for their crimes Other times the creators overlook relatively minor offenders whether due to not considering their actions worthy of punishment or not having the time to see them get their comeuppance within the story Still other times it may not be possible to exact retribution on the characters who ends up becoming Karma Houdinis It could be that theyre too powerful to be subject to retribution any Eldritch Abomination in a horror story is likely to be this as even if they dont outright win they are so beyond mortal comprehension that the best the protagonists can hope for is to simply escape them Or it could be that theres no way to legally judge them because they are above the law in some way and the protagonists are not willing to risk it all for some vigilante justiceCompare ButtMonkey for which a character ends up having many disproportionately bad things happen to them throughout the story and may also technically qualify for this trope as hard as that sounds The extreme counterpart of the former trope Cosmic Plaything can be considered this tropes polar opposite Also compare with No Good Deed Goes Unpunished where the good guy suffers as a result of doing the right thingContrast the aforementioned LaserGuided Karma when the villains comeuppance hits at an incredibly opportune moment and is directly traceable to their transgression Karma Houdini Warranty when the comeuppance only happens in a sequel and Karmic Death when the comeuppance leads to the villains death Also see Idiot Houdini when a person is forever protected from the results of their stupidityNote that a character doesnt necessarily need to be a fulltime villain to qualify for this trope They may simply end up doing unnecessarily hurtful things yet not suffer the repercussions In contrast when someone is too evil to kill off but may suffer other consequences see Joker ImmunityNote also The work usually must be completed for a character to qualify as this trope Only if there are no more opportunities for LaserGuided Karma to strike can a character be said to have successfully avoided any consequences for their actions Exceptions may be made in cases where Status Quo Is Godnote which is why you should not add this trope to the This Image Is Not an Example index or when a character can be said to have permanently escaped eg they died peacefully in their sleep at an old age And sometimes even thats not enough Unless they somehow managed to get into Heaven and are gleefully rubbing their current state in your face Otherwise resist the urge to put it on an ongoing works pageDont mistake a lack of direct karma for this trope If a character for example murders someone and never gets caught but a freak lightning strike kills them theyve still gotten their comeuppance even though the lightning had no connection to their crime Think of the writer as God with the power to punish or not punish a character who does evilNot to be confused with a literal Houdinistyle escape by the villain to avoid justice thats Villain Exit Stage Left although the two certainly can and often do overlapThis is a

a series starts out the characters usually dont have firmly established personalities or appearance since the writers are just getting a feel for them Time goes on more and more episodes are produced and the characters become better defined with their own set of personality and behavioral quirks Or maybe their early personality gradually gave way to something very different due to Character Development andor Flanderization Whatever the case may be though their early incarnations are forgotten about as people look at the firmly established characterizationIn extreme cases a characters actions in early instances of a work can actively contradict their later established behavior For examples early adventures of the noted Technical Pacifist Batman end with him openly killing criminals This is a subtrope of EarlyInstallment WeirdnessA form of Continuity Drift Compare the OutofCharacter Moment and Depending on the Writer or Flanderization where a single trait gets largely exaggerated until its all the character is known for When the characterization is already firmly established but still ends up changing to something completely different for unexplained reasons then this is

but kermit all these terrific funny thing happen when i do answer it kermit im aware of that im aware of that fozzie be there no end to this run gag animal run in and rip the phone off the wall before carry it away fozzie well i guess that put an end to this run gag kermit yeah and also to all the incoming calls— the muppet showa joke whose humor derives from repetition ideally become funnier each time it be repeat must be repeat at least three time otherwise it a brick joke or chekhov gag common variant be a joke that occurs once an episode and a joke that go on for long enough that it becomes an overlylong gag but not so long that it loses it humorthe ultimate fear for the use of any run gag be that do it too often threatens to turn it into an overuse run gag or bad it be never funny in the first place and didnt improve through repetition nothing be bad than start a one hour show with a joke that bomb the first time and reappears twenty more time over the next houra run gag can be limited to a particular episode or recur throughout an entire series if it recurs throughout an entire series then it will often develop variation andor be accompany by lampshade hang if a character break the fourth wall to mention it it didnt we use this joke already when the story go on to kill off the gag for good either with a final payoff or just by reference that it become too overuse and

save by the bellfirst impression count and in tv and film even more so there no point in hire an actor to give u a deadpan snarker if people think theyre seriously be a total ditz until the third act so when the character come into the plot you give them an establish character momentthe establish character moment do not have to be huge it doesnt have to be impressive it doesnt even have to be first it about reveal a character motivation and ability in a single introductory scene they could blow the roof and rappel in from a helicopter with an automatic in each hand but if theyre the woobie it not a good idea unless youre aim for a heartbroken badass like harry dresden or spidermansometimes the first thing need be to set up how they fit into the plot but this may not best reveal their character so the establish character moment may be one or two scene down the line for tv show and their episodic format the character may first do what they need to do in the episode and then near the end establish how the character will fit into the ongoing arc and theme of the showother time the moment may be the small calm when the character carry out something completely unrelated to the plot to show them in their natural element before put them in an unrelenting storm of plot line — for instance during a morning routine sequencewhen it happens it can not be take back a run punt to a puppy will completely color attempt to pet the dog later but if you start with a gentle stroke then some people may get the wrong idea about your villain then again a bait the dog moment may subvert this or it might itself serve to show the complex multifaceted hidden depth of that characterif this happens in a musical it can be in i be song formatsubtropes include baitandswitch character

calvin about moe calvin and hobbessometimes even laserguided karma miss it targetthe character have do a number of thing that deserve a karmic comeuppance most importantly thing that cause harm to the

praise and even elect president and they might even have reverse the humiliation conga that be be plan for them bad come to bad the bad guy win and a steal happy end take place at the expense of the

be spoken karma be out to lunch the villain have become a karma houdinipredictably it be often shock or downright upset to see such scoundrel dodge instant karmic punishment and come out triumphant in the end but a frustrate a it be it do not necessarily make the story bad a long a it doesnt feel force contrive or even shortsighted regardless this trope run the high risk of leave the audience thirst for emotional catharsis unsatiated especially when theyve become so invest in see the villain theyve project their hate onto get their full commupance that may or may not come by the end and when it doesnt you can expect them to complain about it and clamor for a sequel where the villain do get their comeuppance — or alternatively theyll try to satisfy their frustratingly unfulfilled desire for retribution by write their ownthere can be a number of reason for this trope sometimes the story be go for a downer end in which the villain escape justice for their crime other time the creator overlook relatively minor offender whether due to not consider their action worthy of punishment or not have the time to see them get their comeuppance within the story still other time it may not be possible to exact retribution on the character who end up become karma houdini it could be that theyre too powerful to be subject to retribution any eldritch abomination in a horror story be likely to be this a even if they dont outright win they be so beyond mortal comprehension that the best the protagonist can hope for be to simply escape them or it could be that there no way to legally judge them because they be above the law in some way and the protagonist be not willing to risk it all for some vigilante justicecompare buttmonkey for which a character end up have many disproportionately bad thing happen to them throughout the story and may also technically qualify for this trope a hard a that sound the extreme counterpart of the former trope cosmic plaything can be consider this trope polar opposite also compare with no good deed go unpunished where the good guy suffers a a result of do the right thingcontrast the aforementioned laserguided karma when the villain comeuppance hit at an incredibly opportune moment and be directly traceable to their transgression karma houdini warranty when the comeuppance only happens in a sequel and karmic death when the comeuppance lead to the villain death also see idiot houdini when a person be forever protect from the result of their stupiditynote that a character doesnt necessarily need to be a fulltime villain to qualify for this trope they may simply end up do unnecessarily hurtful thing yet not suffer the repercussion in contrast when someone be too evil to kill off but may suffer other consequence see joker immunitynote also the work usually must be complete for a character to qualify a this trope only if there be no more opportunity for laserguided karma to strike can a character be say to have successfully avoid any consequence for their action exception may be make in case where status quo be godnote which be why you should not add this trope to the this image be not an example index or when a character can be say to have permanently escape eg they die peacefully in their sleep at an old age and sometimes even thats not enough unless they somehow manage to get into heaven and be gleefully rub their current state in your face otherwise resist the urge to put it on an ongoing work pagedont mistake a lack of direct karma for this trope if a character for example murder someone and never get caught but a freak lightning strike kill them theyve still gotten their comeuppance even though the lightning have no connection to their crime think of the writer a god with the power to punish or not punish a character who do evilnot to be confuse with a literal houdinistyle escape by the villain to avoid justice thats villain exit stage left although the two
