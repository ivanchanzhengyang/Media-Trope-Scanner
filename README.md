## Problem Statement

**Identifying tropes in creative works is time-consuming and challenging.**

**Writers, filmmakers, and storytellers struggle to use tropes effectively and avoid clichés.**

**Fans of popular culture find it difficult to understand the tropes in their favorite stories.**

**Solution:** A trope scanner automates trope identification, saving time and enhancing storytelling.

**Applications:**

- Writers use it for inspiration.
- Filmmakers avoid clichés.
- Fans explore the history and significance of tropes.

## Key Questions

In the context of trope analysis and storytelling, we aim to address the following key questions:

1. How can we effectively automate the identification of tropes in creative works, making it more accessible to writers, filmmakers, and fans?
2. What challenges do we encounter in developing a trope scanner that accurately identifies and categorizes tropes, considering the diversity and complexity of creative works?

## Background

TV Tropes: A Compendium of Recurring Narrative Elements/A wiki website collecting common storytelling elements

**Founded in 2004 by Anthony "Ant" Wandtke and Michael "Mike" Drew**

**Valuable resource for writers, filmmakers, and fans**

**Trope: A repository of recurring storytelling elements in fiction**

**Examples: Hero's Journey, Chekhov's Gun, Coming of Age Story**

**Tropes can enhance or hinder storytelling**

**Skillful use empowers compelling narratives**

In the world of creative storytelling, understanding and utilizing narrative tropes are essential for crafting engaging and compelling tales. TV Tropes, a comprehensive compendium of recurring narrative elements, has been a valuable resource for writers, filmmakers, and fans since its founding in 2004 by Anthony "Ant" Wandtke and Michael "Mike" Drew.

A trope, at its core, is a repository of recurring storytelling elements in fiction. Examples range from the classic Hero's Journey to the subtle Chekhov's Gun or the timeless Coming of Age Story. Tropes serve as the building blocks of narratives, capable of both enhancing and hindering storytelling, depending on their skillful use.

In this project, I endeavor to streamline the process of trope identification and analysis. My Trope Media Scanner is designed to automate this time-consuming and challenging task, making it a valuable tool for writers, filmmakers, and fans alike. By providing a user-friendly platform to explore and understand the tropes in their favorite stories, I aim to empower and inspire creativity, while also helping storytellers avoid clichés and explore the rich history and significance of narrative tropes.

Now, let's dive deeper into the features, installation, and usage of the Trope Media Scanner to see how it can revolutionize the way we engage with storytelling elements.

## Datasets

### Data Collection

**Media sources used:**
- Full episode summary: [Simpsons Fandom Season 1](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Season_1)
- Trope source: [TV Tropes Recap of The Simpsons Season 1 Episodes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsons) (Only Season 1 episodes used)
- **Reason for Choice:** Extensive data, well-maintained wiki, comprehensive trope definitions

In the development of my Trope Media Scanner, I leveraged a wealth of data from "The Simpsons," a long-running and well-documented television series. This iconic show, spanning over three decades, served as the primary data source for training and testing my trope scanner. 

The decision to choose "The Simpsons" was guided by the availability of an extensive and well-maintained wiki, The Simpsons Fandom, which offered full episode summaries and detailed character information. Additionally, TV Tropes, a comprehensive database of tropes, was an invaluable source for identifying and classifying tropes within the text, ensuring a robust foundation for my scanner.

This carefully selected combination of media sources empowers our scanner to effectively and comprehensively analyze and identify recurring narrative elements, providing a valuable tool for writers, filmmakers, and fans seeking to explore the world of storytelling in "The Simpsons" and beyond.





## Applications

The Trope Media Scanner offers a wide range of applications for various users:

- A screenwriter struggling with a new script can use the tool to identify overused tropes and explore alternative narrative approaches.

- A novelist researching a historical novel can use the tool to identify tropes commonly used in works of historical fiction, ensuring historical accuracy and genre conventions.

- A film director preparing to adapt a book into a movie can use the tool to analyze the book's tropes and plan how to translate them effectively into a visual medium.

- A fan of a popular TV show can use the tool to identify the show's recurring tropes, gain a deeper appreciation for the show's storytelling, and connect with other fans who enjoy similar tropes.

## Current Limitations

My Trope Media Scanner, while a powerful tool for narrative analysis, does have certain limitations:

1. **Language Barrier:** Currently, the tool is limited to analyzing English-language input, which restricts its accessibility to a wider international audience.

2. **Structured Text Focus:** The tool is primarily designed for structured text-based media sources, such as wiki transcripts and summaries, scripts, and novels. This limits its application to other forms of media.

3. **Internationalization:** I recognize the importance of internationalization, and I aim to address this limitation by expanding the tool's capabilities.

4. **Global Trope Recognition:** TV Tropes, the underlying knowledge base for my tool, already encompasses non-English media, demonstrating the global relevance of tropes.

5. **Bridging Linguistic and Cultural Gaps:** I have ambitious plans to expand the tool's analysis capabilities to a broader international audience, with the goal of bridging language and cultural barriers, fostering a more inclusive understanding of tropes.

## Expansion Plans

In my commitment to enhancing the utility and inclusivity of my Trope Media Scanner, I have outlined the following expansion plans:

1. **Non-Structured Text Media Support:** I plan to enhance the tool's versatility by enabling support for non-structured text media, such as blog posts and social media content. This expansion will broaden the tool's applicability to a wide range of content types.

2. **Audio Analysis Integration:** I am exploring the incorporation of audio content, including podcasts and dialogues, into the tool's analysis. This will provide a deeper understanding of trope usage in auditory mediums.

3. **Image Recognition Functionality:** Extending the tool's functionality to analyze images will allow for the identification of tropes within visual elements. This recognizes that a single image can convey multiple narrative devices.

4. **Video Media Inclusion:** I aim to include video media analysis, providing a comprehensive trope-scanning experience across various forms of media, including content creators like YouTubers who create "What-If" scenarios without existing wikis.

These expansion plans reflect my commitment to continuously improving and expanding the capabilities of my Trope Media Scanner, making it an even more versatile and inclusive tool for narrative analysis across a variety of media sources.
