## Background

TV Tropes: A Compendium of Recurring Narrative Elements/A wiki website collecting common storytelling elements

**Founded in 2004 by Anthony "Ant" Wandtke and Michael "Mike" Drew**

**Valuable resource for writers, filmmakers, and fans**

**Trope: A repository of recurring storytelling elements in fiction**

**Examples: Hero's Journey, Chekhov's Gun, Coming of Age Story**

**Tropes can enhance or hinder storytelling**

**Skillful use empowers compelling narratives**

In the world of creative storytelling, understanding and utilizing narrative tropes are essential for crafting engaging and compelling tales. TV Tropes, a comprehensive compendium of recurring narrative elements, has been a valuable resource for writers, filmmakers, and fans since its founding in 2004 by Anthony "Ant" Wandtke and Michael "Mike" Drew.

A trope, at its core, is a repository of recurring storytelling elements in fiction. Examples range from the classic Hero's Journey to the subtle Chekhov's Gun or the timeless Coming of Age Story. Tropes serve as the building blocks of narratives, capable of both enhancing and hindering storytelling, depending on their skillful use.

In this project, we endeavor to streamline the process of trope identification and analysis. Our Trope Media Scanner is designed to automate this time-consuming and challenging task, making it a valuable tool for writers, filmmakers, and fans alike. By providing a user-friendly platform to explore and understand the tropes in their favorite stories, we aim to empower and inspire creativity, while also helping storytellers avoid clichés and explore the rich history and significance of narrative tropes.

Now, let's dive deeper into the features, installation, and usage of the Trope Media Scanner to see how it can revolutionize the way we engage with storytelling elements.

## Datasets

### Data Collection

**Media sources used:**
- Full episode summary: [Simpsons Fandom Season 1](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Season_1)
- Trope source: [TV Tropes Recap of The Simpsons Season 1 Episodes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsons) (Only Season 1 episodes used)
- **Reason for Choice:** Extensive data, well-maintained wiki, comprehensive trope definitions

In the development of our Trope Media Scanner, we leveraged a wealth of data from "The Simpsons," a long-running and well-documented television series. This iconic show, spanning over three decades, served as the primary data source for training and testing our trope scanner. 

The decision to choose "The Simpsons" was guided by the availability of an extensive and well-maintained wiki, Simpsons Fandom, which offered full episode summaries and detailed character information. Additionally, TV Tropes, a comprehensive database of tropes, was an invaluable source for identifying and classifying tropes within the text, ensuring a robust foundation for our scanner.

This carefully selected combination of media sources empowers our scanner to effectively and comprehensively analyze and identify recurring narrative elements, providing a valuable tool for writers, filmmakers, and fans seeking to explore the world of storytelling in "The Simpsons" and beyond.
