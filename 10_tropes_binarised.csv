even more so theres no point in hiring an actor to give us a Deadpan Snarker if people think theyre seriously being a total ditz until the third act So when the character comes into the plot you give them an Establishing Character MomentThe establishing character moment does not have to be huge it doesnt have to be impressive it doesnt even have to be first Its about revealing a characters motivations and abilities in a single introductory scene They could blow the roof and rappel in from a helicopter with an automatic in each hand but if theyre The Woobie its not a good idea unless youre aiming for a Heartbroken Badass like Harry Dresden or SpiderManSometimes the first thing needed is to set up how they fit into the plot but this may not best reveal their character So the Establishing Character Moment may be one or two scenes down the line For TV shows and their episodic format the character may first do what they need to do in the episode and then near the end establish how the character will fit into the ongoing arcs and themes of the showOther times the Moment may be the small calm when the character carries out something completely unrelated to the plot to show them in their natural element before putting them in an unrelenting storm of plot lines — for instance during a Morning Routine sequenceWhen it happens it cannot be taken back A running punt to a puppy will completely color attempts to Pet the Dog later but if you start with a gentle stroke then some people may get the wrong idea about your villain Then again a Bait the Dog moment may subvert this or it might itself serve to show the complex multifaceted Hidden Depths of that characterIf this happens in a musical it can be in I Am Song formatSubtropes include BaitandSwitch

incinerated by bolts of lightning— Calvin about Moe Calvin and HobbesSometimes even LaserGuided Karma misses its targetThe character has done a number of things that deserve a karmic comeuppance most importantly things that caused harm to the innocent But when the time comes for the hammer to fall thats not what happens At least not on them They dont get what they deserve Instead they get away scotfree They are Easily Forgiven maybe even praised and even elected president And they might even have reversed the Humiliation Conga that was being planned for them Worst comes to worst The Bad Guy Wins and a stolen happy ending takes place at the expense of the hapless victim who may be punished in the guilty characters placeThis is it This is all there is to the story The show is over The book is finished The author isnt going to write any more The Word of God has been spoken Karma is out to lunch The villain has become a Karma HoudiniPredictably it is often shocking or downright upsetting to see such scoundrels dodge instant karmic punishment and come out triumphant in the end But as frustrating as it is it does not necessarily make the story worse as long as it doesnt feel forced contrived or even shortsighted Regardless this trope runs the high risk of leaving the audiences thirst for emotional catharsis unsatiated especially when theyve become so invested in seeing the villain theyve projected their hate onto get their full commupance that may or may not come by the end And when it doesnt you can expect them to complain about it and clamor for a sequel where the villain does get their comeuppance — or alternatively theyll try to satisfy their frustratingly unfulfilled desire for retribution by writing their ownThere can be a number of reasons for this trope Sometimes the story is going for a Downer Ending in which the villains escape justice for their crimes Other times the creators overlook relatively minor offenders whether due to not considering their actions worthy of punishment or not having the time to see them get their comeuppance within the story Still other times it may not be possible to exact retribution on the characters who ends up becoming Karma Houdinis It could be that theyre too powerful to be subject to retribution any Eldritch Abomination in a horror story is likely to be this as even if they dont outright win they are so beyond mortal comprehension that the best the protagonists can hope for is to simply escape them Or it could be that theres no way to legally judge them because they are above the law in some way and the protagonists are not willing to risk it all for some vigilante justiceCompare ButtMonkey for which a character ends up having many disproportionately bad things happen to them throughout the story and may also technically qualify for this trope as hard as that sounds The extreme counterpart of the former trope Cosmic Plaything can be considered this tropes polar opposite Also compare with No Good Deed Goes Unpunished where the good guy suffers as a result of doing the right thingContrast the aforementioned LaserGuided Karma when the villains comeuppance hits at an incredibly opportune moment and is directly traceable to their transgression Karma Houdini Warranty when the comeuppance only happens in a sequel and Karmic Death when the comeuppance leads to the villains death Also see Idiot Houdini when a person is forever protected from the results of their stupidityNote that a character doesnt necessarily need to be a fulltime villain to qualify for this trope They may simply end up doing unnecessarily hurtful things yet not suffer the repercussions In contrast when someone is too evil to kill off but may suffer other consequences see Joker ImmunityNote also The work usually must be completed for a character to qualify as this trope Only if there are no more opportunities for LaserGuided Karma to strike can a character be said to have successfully avoided any consequences for their actions Exceptions may be made in cases where Status Quo Is Godnote which is why you should not add this trope to the This Image Is Not an Example index or when a character can be said to have permanently escaped eg they died peacefully in their sleep at an old age And sometimes even thats not enough Unless they somehow managed to get into Heaven and are gleefully rubbing their current state in your face Otherwise resist the urge to put it on an ongoing works pageDont mistake a lack of direct karma for this trope If a character for example murders someone and never gets caught but a freak lightning strike kills them theyve still gotten their comeuppance even though the lightning had no connection to their crime Think of the writer as God with the power to punish or not punish a character who does evilNot to be confused with a literal Houdinistyle escape by the villain to avoid justice thats Villain Exit Stage Left although the two certainly can and often do
