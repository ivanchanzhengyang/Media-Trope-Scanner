    "TV Tropes is a wiki website that collects and describes common plot devices, character archetypes, and other storytelling elements. It is a valuable resource for writers, filmmakers, and other storytellers, as well as fans of popular culture who want to learn more about the stories they love. Some examples of tropes that are covered on TV Tropes include [the Hero's Journey](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerosJourney), [Chekhov's Gun](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun), and [Coming of Age story](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAgeStory)."

    "Identifying tropes in creative works can be a time-consuming and challenging task, especially for long or complex works. This can make it difficult for writers, filmmakers, and other storytellers to identify and use tropes effectively, and to avoid clichés. Additionally, fans of popular culture may have difficulty learning more about the tropes used in their favorite stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trope scanner can help to solve this problem by automating the process of identifying tropes in creative works. This can save writers, filmmakers, and other storytellers a significant amount of time, and can help them to create more engaging and original stories. Additionally, a trope scanner can make it easier for fans of popular culture to learn more about the tropes used in their favorite stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some specific examples of how a trope scanner can be used:\n",
    "- A writer can use a trope scanner to identify and use tropes effectively in their work. For example, a writer could use a trope scanner to find examples of the Hero's Journey trope in popular movies, and then use those examples to inform their own writing.\n",
    "- A filmmaker can use a trope scanner to identify and avoid clichés in their films. For example, a filmmaker could use a trope scanner to find examples of the [Deus ex Machina](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina) trope, and then avoid using that trope in their own films.\n",
    "- A fan of popular culture can use a trope scanner to learn more about the tropes used in their favorite stories. For example, a fan of superhero movies could use a trope scanner to find examples of the [Secret Identity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity) trope, and then learn more about the history and significance of that trope."

into a pile of snow at the front of Springfield Elementary School park Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduce the second grade The children do a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world such as Ralph Wiggum as Hotei Oshō Dewey Largo introduces Lisa playing Tawanga the Santa Claus of the South Seas Lisa’s dance causes awe throughout the crowd Lisa performs a skilled dance with lit torches performing tricks such as throwing it around herself – Lisa also wears seethrough clothing effectively ‘revealing Lisa completely at the end of her act Skinner eventually introduces the fourth grade singing Christmas carols Jingle Bells is sung first and after the first verse Bart picks up his voice volume during the chorus and sings a Batmanthemed parody causing an irate Skinner to withdraw Bart from the performance Homer gives a disappointed look for Barts actions but as the pageant continues he grows bored and wonders aloud how long the pageant will lastAt the Simpson family home Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards as Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names and stories Marge soon stops writing due to Homers grumpy demeanor Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists Marge is uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover

idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the episode finished thirtieth in the week of December 11–17 1989 It concluded with a Nielsen rating of 145 and was viewed in approximately 134 million homes'"

uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless

it when he cheats and makes up an imaginary word “Kwyjibo” Before he leaves Homer roughly grabs Bart and accuses him of cheating He then forces him to define Kwyjibo Bart eventually defines it as “A big dumb balding North American ape with no chin” Marge adds minor detail to the definition of Kwyjibo with and a short temper This causes Homer to become instantly angered and chases Bart out of the room as Bart replies Uhoh Kwyjibo on the looseThe next day before class in the schoolyard Bart is spraypainting graffiti that defames Principal Skinner on the school building Principal Skinner is watching the kids on the playground Martin Prince the school genius tattles about the graffiti Milhouse one of Barts friends sees Martin informing Skinner and warns Bart Skinner arrives where Bart

shorts Mrs Krabappel hands out aptitude tests to everyone When she instructs the class on taking the timed intelligence test Martin raises his hand and reminds her that Bart is supposed to face the window during any test so he can’t cheat A grumbling Bart turns his desk to face the window and the test begins In an attempt to figure out a lengthy math word problem Bart tries to quietly read the problem so he can solve it Mrs Krabappel reminds him for visualization instead The visualization turns into a daydream and when Bart finally comes back to reality Martin announces that he has finished his test already Mrs Krabappel allows Martin go outside to read a book during the remainder of the testing period While Bart is still taking his test he looks out the window to see a smug Martin sticking his tongue out at him In retaliation Bart sticks his tongue out and makes faces back at Martin after Martin does the same Mrs Krabappel spots Bart making faces and looks out the window to see

permanent record and is about to suggest something along the lines of expulsion for Bart his secretary buzzes in and says that Dr J Loren Pryor the school counselor is waiting to see him Dr Pryor walks in on the meeting and surprises everyone when he tells them that Bart is a “gifted child” and according to the aptitude test from earlier Bart has an IQ of 216 Dr Pryor suggests that Bart’s history of bad behavior stems from a lack of interest in his school work due to the fact that it is too easy for him Skinner wants Bart retested but when Dr Pryor suggests moving Bart to a school for gifted children Skinner jumps on board with the idea and Bart quickly agrees when he hears that the school doesn’t have much structure and that you get to make your own rules Dr Pryor hands Bart some paperwork for the “gifted children” school and he Homer and Marge leave the meeting stunnedThe next morning at the breakfast table Marge and Homer hover around their new genius child and Homer tells Lisa to start eating what Bart eats for breakfast so she can become a genius too However Lisa is not fooled by Bart and knows that he is still just a dimwit After breakfast Homer takes Bart to the “Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children” Once inside the school they find Bart’s class and after peeking in they see that all the boys are wearing ties So Homer gives Bart the tie he is wearing and he gives Bart a little pep talk about his first day at the new school and shoves him in the classroom door Once inside the class Ms Mellon the teacher introduces herself and the new classmates to Bart and shows him around the classroom She tells Bart about the independent learning and that the only rule is for him to make his own rules Class begins with a debate on the topic of free will and the paradoxes that it creates Bart struggles to understand the discussion Later at lunch Bart’s classmates realize that Bart isn’t really that smart when he accepts their ridiculously uneven trade

Bart walks home from school he passes by the playground of his old school where Richard Lewis and Milhouse are shooting marbles When Bart greets them and tries to talk to them they treat him like a nerd call him names and tell him to get lost Cut to later at dinner as a depressed Bart eats Marge reminds everyone that they can’t be late for the film festival that she bought tickets for as another way to nurture Bart’s brain Bart is reluctant to go to the festival and Homer tells him they don’t have to Just as Bart is about to tell Homer what is on his mind and confess about the false IQ test Homer insists on going outside to play catch After playing catch Bart sees how much being a genius means to Homer and chooses not to confess about what he has done out of fear of disappointing himThe next day at the “gifted children” school while performing a chemistry experiment Bart accidentally causes an explosion which results in green goo everywhere Later at Dr Pyror’s office a greenstained Bart meets with Dr Pyror They discuss the reasoning behind his recent failings at the new school and Dr Pyror thinks that once again Bart isn’t being challenged enough while Bart suggests that he just go back to Springfield Elementary When Dr Pryor wants to know why Bart makes up an excuse and tells Dr Pryor he would like to go undercover and study regular kids and their school environment “to see what makes ‘em tick” Dr Pryor agrees and tells Bart to write up a proposal to present to Principal Skinner while he goes to talk to him Bart struggles to write a proposal and instead changes his mind and writes his confession When Dr Pryor comes back in the office and reads Bart’s confession he suddenly realizes that Bart misspelled confessionLater at home a still greenstained Bart greets his

solve his problems by committing suicide Homer writes the family a farewell note and heads outside In the backyard with intentions of jumping off a bridge Homer ties one end of a rope around his waist and the other end around a large boulder A tearful Homer looks back at the house one last time and then struggles down the road alone with the boulder in his armsHomer continues on his journey to the bridge while back at the house Bart and Lisa rush in to Marge’s room and wake her up telling her they’ve been robbed Bart thinks they have been robbed because his piggy bank is stolen but then Lisa discovers Homer’s note and everyone gasps Cut back to Homer as he nears the bridge he crosses an intersection without a stop sign and is nearly struck by an oncoming car Homer continues on to the bridge where he finds an identical boulder to the one hes just carried across town and just as he is about to jump into the water below Marge and the kids running behind Homer shout from a distance and tell him to stop As they rush over to Homer they cross the intersection and are also nearly hit by a car But Homer quickly runs in and pushes them out of the way He comments on how dangerous the intersection is and how someone should put a stop sign there Suddenly a light goes on in Homer’s head and he realizes that he now has a purpose in life to make the intersection saferThe next day at City Hall Homer presents his proposal for a stop sign at 12th and D Street the dangerous intersection His proposal is accepted and a stunned Homer feels a greater sense of purpose and chooses to go on a campaign to make all of Springfield safer A montage of newspaper headlines ensues chronicling all of Homer’s new signs and his growing public support Later the next week after the town has been covered with safety signs Homer still feels he must do more and plans to take on the nuclear power plant and attempt to make it safer The next day at the power plant in front of a large cheering crowd Homer stages a protest about the lack of safety at the power plant Mr Burns glowers down at the protest from high above through his office window and orders Smithers to bring Homer to him to talk privately Smithers goes down to the protest retrieves Homer and sends him to Mr Burns’ office Once inside Mr Burns offers Homer a new job at the plant as the safety inspector which would have a considerably larger salary than his old job as a technical supervisor Homer mulls over the job offer and accepts Mr Burns tells Homer that his first duty is to step out on the balcony and lie to the crowd and tell them the power plant is safe Homer reluctantly steps on the balcony to lie to the crowd and suddenly has a change of mind he heads back into Burns’ office and tells him he can’t do it Burns realizes that Homer is very passionate about safety and won’t back down to anything he keeps Homer on as the safety inspector anyway Homer goes back out to the balcony to announce to everyone his new job the crowd cheers and Homer does a celebratory dance on the balcony ledge However Homer the safety inspector himself falls off the balcony The crowd catches him below and they carry him off on their shoulders chanting his name and finishing the episodeHomers OdysseyTranscriptThe cartoon at the power plant was given an oldtime reel footage feel by having the animation cels dragged across a cement floor to scratch it up This trick was used several more times by the animators until the show abandoned animation cels in 2002This episode marks the first appearance of Mr Smithers He was AfricanAmerican instead of yellow According to David Silverman Gyorgi Peluci the color stylist randomly planned the ethnicity of various characters which usually wasnt much of a problem but it sort of ruined the white sycophant personality for Smithers In his next appearance he was colored right but still with blue hair Although Mr Burns was seen in Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire this was his first appearance in order of production codes as well as the first use of his name hence the dramatic music when the camera pans out on himWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood the authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide stated that the story rather fizzles out at the end but there are many good moments especially in the power plant</td>\n",

attention to Marge whos still intoxicated and asking him to drive home before she throws up in his car He imagines the mans family driving off to Heaven while he is driving his own family in Hell Homer goes back home in his reality now knowing how much Marge Bart and Lisa embarrassed him in front of his bossThe next day Marge and the kids eat TV dinners in the living room and watch TV together when Homer walks in and plans that tonight they are all going to eat at the dinner table like a normal family At the dinner table the rest of the Simpsons are not taking Homers attempt to get them to eat like a normal family seriously and continue eating like cavemen During his prayer Homer expresses his dissatisfaction with his troubled familys behavior and ponders why he was cursed with those who disrespect him When Marge and the kids claim there is nothing is wrong with the family Homer chooses to prove that there is something wrong with them He leads the family in a tour around the neighborhood peeking into random houses to observe their neighbors’ normal family life However the rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homers sudden rash behavior in the tour and tries to convince

dinner table not ignore a family member and eating dinner while watching TV in the living room A neighbor notices Homer spying on his family and fires warning rounds from his shotgun By the time they

they received reports of a neighborhood stalker The dog suspects Homer and growls at them to pay attention Luckily for him the two cops are too dumb to notice anything and drag the dog away After getting into a brief fight with Barney Homer later sees a commercial for Dr Marvin Monroes Family Therapy Center Dr Monroe guarantees family bliss or double your money back Homer then gets an idea to make his family normalMarge and the kids watch an Itchy  Scratchy cartoon when Homer walks in the living room and announces he has made an appointment at Dr Monroe’s Family Therapy Center The family is reluctant to the idea but Homer is on a mission to make his family better Marge tries to claim that theres still nothing wrong with their family but Homer doesnt listen In order to raise the 250 needed for the session Homer pawns the TV much to the rest of the familys horrorThe therapy treatment begins as Dr Monroe brings them into another room and sits them down He encourages them each to draw a picture that represents the source of their unhappiness Most of the Simpsons vent their anger out by drawing Homer as they see him while Homer gets lost in the exercise by drawing airplanes dropping bombs on his family When Dr Monroe sees this he points out to Homer that had he been paying attention he wouldve known his family sees him as an abusive and stern disciplinarian Monroe also calls him an ogre a word that Marge and Lisa disagree with claiming ogre is too much Bart agrees with Monroe making Homer furious enough to attack him Dr Monroe calms Homer down and asks the family to try different exercises such as the foam padded aversion mallets that Bart turns into a hard weapon by removing the foam padding from his mallet and striking Dr Monroe with it Soon Dr Monroe sees that the Simpson family is not responding to conventional treatment so his next exercise becomes different He places each of the Simpsons in their own chair hooked up to deliver an electric shock Each chair has buttons that when pressed will deliver an electric shock to another corresponding chair With all of the Simpsons strapped in Dr Monroe instructs them only to shock someone else if that person hurts them emotionally However the family members quickly start shocking each other over minor slights and then things go totally off the rails when Maggie starts hitting all the buttons at random leading to a power brownout across the entire city much to Mr Burns joy as this increased use of electricity means more money for his companyDr Monroe soon tires of the Simpsons and unplugs the generator He tells them that theyre beyond his help and orders them to leave but Homer refuses reminding Monroe of his doublemoney back guarantee Dr Monroe grudingly agrees and furiously hands over 500 while ordering them to leave and never tell anyone they were ever there The family leaves more than satisfied given their unexpected windfall and cannot help but feel more united Homer decides to use the money to buy a brand new TV and the Simpsons happily head homeTheres No Disgrace Like HomeTranscriptThe episode shows telltale signs of being one of the earliest shows of the season produced The characters act slightly different from how they would in later seasons For example Lisa is an undisciplined brat Marge is a drunk and inattentive whereas Homer is concerned and the voice of reason for his family It was an early episode for Mr Burns in which he had a voice different from the one it would later become Originally the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan which was later dropped The idea that he would greet his employees using index cards was inspired by how Ronald Reagan would greet people The episode marks the first time Burns says release the hounds It also marked the first appearance of Eddie and Lou although Lou was not black but instead yellow like the rest of the characters Lou was named after Lou Whitaker  a former Major League Baseball player It is the first appearance of Itchy  Scratchy although the cat and mouse duo appeared in the shortsThe idea behind the scene in which the family take turns to electrically shock each other was based on Laurel and Hardy throwing pies at each other albeit played out more sadistically The scene was rearranged in the editing room because when it was first produced it played out differently The edits made to the finished product were preliminary however they were received well and remained unchangedBurns and SmithersThis episode marks the introduction of Dr Marvin Monroe Itchy and Scratchy and Eddie and Lou two of Springfields policemen Lou was colored yellow by mistake in this episode same mistake made in Krusty Gets Busted though he is later an AfricanAmerican and Smithers who was drawn as an AfricanAmerican in the previous episode is drawn in yellow a shade or two lighter than Burns in this one This episode also marks the first use of Burns release the hounds commentThe authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood note Its very strange to see Homer pawning the TV set in an attempt to save the family if this episode had come later Marge would surely have taken this stance They continue A neat swipe at family counseling with some great set pieces were especially fond of the perfect version of the Simpsons and the electricshock aversion therapy In a DVD review of the first season David B Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2050 placing it as one of the worst of the seasonThis episode would have been one of the first seen by British viewers It was the first episode to be broadcast by the BBC on November 23 1996 on a Saturday at 530pm because the episodes were shown out of order The episode was screened with five million viewers that was slightly less than the show Dads Army a British series revolving around a misfit military platoon which previously held the timeslot The episode also faced competition from ITVs screening of Sabrina the Teenage Witch This was unless you had a subscription to SKY TV in the 90s as they showed the episodes in order from September 2 1990 the first being The Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire It was said to be the savior of Sky TV from being an instant failureThe scene where the family turn electrically shocking each other would later appear in

classroom Bart daydreams again this time about his own funeral in which his family mourns him especially Homer who has then grown a conscience and realized that his son was more important than work Lisa places a cupcake on Bart reflecting on how the fight was her responsibility Nelson notices this and pounds him one last time Back in reality after school a nervous Bart darts around the

that he hopes he has learned his lesson and reaches to untie him but Nelson says as soon as he is free he is going to pound BartInside the Simpson house Herman draws up a peace treaty between Bart and Nelson which they both sign Marge steps in and hands out cupcakes everyone In the conclusion of the episode Bart sits on a table in a library and finishes the episode by telling the viewers about the seriousness of warThis is the first episode to not feature a chalkboard gag or a couch gag since the episode’s running time was too long to use the normal opening sequence Instead they just cut to an image of the Simpson house David Silverman was the director and was kind of stressed because he was doing storyboards for this episode while also directing Bart the Genius Originally he had planned to use the song “War” by Edwin Starr in the episode The plans were dropped when they agreed that the song did not really fit the story The episode had problems with the censors who did not want the characters to say family jewels on prime time television The producers ignored the notes and family jewels remained in the episodeTwo new characters were introduced in this episode The first one is Nelson Muntz who remains a commonly used recurring character The second is Herman who has been used less The design of Herman except for only having one arm was inspired by the look of the writer John Swartzwelder The voice was partly inspired by George H W Bush and performed by Harry Shearer The original idea with Herman was that every time he would be shown he would have a different story to why he only has one armMatt Groening notes on the commentary track that he finds it strange how controversial this episode seemed at the time of its release Today they would go a lot further and to him this episode now seems harmless The authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said Some good lines and set pieces aside  we love Barts fantasy of death at Nelsons hands  this episode nevertheless feels a bit unsure of itself particularly towards the end In a DVD review of the first season David B Grelck gave the episode a rating of 35 and adds Another episode that helped to propel Barts popularity into the stratosphereBart the General and Seinfelds The Tape were used in a Dartmouth College experiment to study brain activity in relation to humorous moments in television shows The results were published in a 2004 issue of the academic journal Neurological The researchers noted During moments of humor

raised on the later seasons scurrying to the bathroom Yes the final moments may give you goosepimples and are a world away from the antischmaltz normally associated with the series but there is still

upcoming trial and history of Krusty the Clown including the fact that Krusty has a pacemaker Reverend Lovejoy calls for a public burning of all Krusty merchandise The next day as Krusty walks up the steps to the courthouse Bart and Lisa watch in disbelief The man they see is far different from the clown in the gaudy outfit on TV this Krusty is without makeup and wearing a prison uniform with small feet as he is without his signature oversized shoes Inside the courtroom during the trial Homer being called as a witness points out Krusty to the jury as the robber Later back at the house Homer and Marge gather up all the Krusty merchandise in the house and head to the public burningAn upset Bart watches as the pile of merchandise goes up in flames The next day at the trial it is revealed after being asked to identify some evidence that Krusty is illiterate The evidence that Krusty is asked to identify are betting slips which suggests Krusty committed the robbery as this evidence combined with an audit of Krustys finances shows he lost considerable amounts of money illegally wagering on sporting events which Krusty admits to Later the jury reaches a guilty verdict At the Simpson house Lisa and Maggie watch Sideshow Bob who has now taken over for Krusty on TV He promises that while the show will be more educational it will retain the popular The Itchy  Scratchy

show is about to start but he offers them free tickets In the audience a visibly saddened Bart watches the show When Sideshow Bob notices Barts sadness he invites him on stage for a new psychological segment of the show called Choices While on stage Bart reveals he is sad because he thinks that Krusty was framed and wrongfully jailed but Bob tries to convince him otherwise brushing off the clues he and Lisa found by claiming that Krusty was never one to follow doctors orders seriously and pointing out that The Springfield Review of Books contains amusing caricatures that anyone can enjoy Bob does get sore when Bart reminds him of the time he used to be Krustys sidekick which he remarks darkly that the clown shot him out of a cannon When Bob mentions that he has big shoes to fill Bart connects the final piece of the mystery together recalling that Homer stepped on the robbers toes and made him scream in pain However when he and Lisa saw Krusty going into the courtroom they noticed that he had normal sized feet Bart believes if he had actually been there at the KwikEMart and Homer step on his shoes he would never felt it Remembering that Bob has feet large enough to fill Krustys clown shoes from their attempt to speak to him Bart concludes that Bob is the real robber and he was the one who yelled at Homer for stepping on his feetOutraged by the truth Bart rightfully levels his accusation towards Sideshow Bob He grabs the microphone and contends to the audience about his new discovery Bart then proves his point by smashing the end of Bobs clown shoe with a mallet This causes Bob to scream in pain and say the exact words spoken by the robber much to the kids shock Bart pounds Bobs other foot causing him to fall down and removes his shoes to expose his big feet on TV as the audience turn on Bob for what he did to Krusty While watching the show and eating donuts the police realize Bart is right and they overlooked one key piece of evidence that could have kept

studio an arrested and exposed Bob dramatically confesses to the crime He reveals that he framed Krusty for the KwikEMart robbery out of frustration because he finally got sick of constantly being on the receiving end of Krustys humiliating antics for more ratings as well as the fact that Krusty squandered much of the shows profits on gambling and other examples of his vulgar appetites Bob felt his intelligence was wasted on the show and wanted Krusty gone so he could make an educational program where his intelligence would be appreciated by the public Before being carted off to jail Bob pays a grudging kudos to the Simpson children with the often used line from ScoobyDoo I would have gotten away with it too if it hadnt been for those meddling kids and swears revenge on Bart for foiling his plan He dramatically warns criminals to start treating children as equals because they were smart enough to catch him and will do the same to them The charges against Krusty are dropped and he now regains the trust of the community Chief Wiggum and the citizens apologize to Krusty for their misunderstanding and Homer offers an apology for fingering him in court Grateful to be free

kisses Homer as she turns the lamp off for bedtimeA work print of the episode was the first to come back from Korea as episodes of The Simpsons are often animated overseas to a South Korean animation studio AKOM due to the overload of episodes and saving costs in Korea The Simpsons Shorts where everything was produced inhouse in KlaskyCsupo although the domestic studio produces only the character and background layout of episodes The original rough version of Some Enchanted Evening is incomplete as it ends when Bart and Lisa just find out Miss Botz is Americas Most Wanted and sound effects and a soundtrack are absent and would have been inserted had there been a final version The work print was not well received in the Gracie Films bungalow with James L Brooks giving a response with profanity Some Enchanted Evening was the first one produced explaining why its 7G01The Simpsons Pilot EpisodeSome scenes of the original version of the episodeThe producers wanted a realistic environment for The Simpsons as other studios had unrealistic styles for animation such as Disney Warner Bros HannaBarbera etc The former two had a universe where the universe was bendy and characters seemed to be made out of rubber HannaBarbera used cartoon sounds which were also declined While the shorts lacked much realism in animation the halfhour series had been intended to be as realistic as possible despite the unrealistic animation 70 of the episodes had to be redone The episode was worked on during the course of the first season until finally being aired on May 13 1990 as the season finale The producers considered aborting production of the series if the next episode Bart the Genius has similar production difficulties although fortunately had several fixable animation problems They convinced FOX to postpone the season premiere for several months Although Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire the eighth episode in production order had to be aired as it was a Christmas special in December of 1989 becoming the first episode of the first season and the first episode of The Simpsons overallAlso at the end of this episode originally Marge would reveal that under her blue hair contained a pair of rabbit ears This is a clear reference to Matt Groenings comic ¨Life in Hell¨ But this ending was scraped for unknown reasons This theory made it into ¨The Simpsons Arcade Game¨ When Marge gets electrified in the game you can see rabbit ears in her hairAlthough the episode was the first produced of Season 1 and the series with its production code being 7G01 as opposed to later codes such as 7G08 from the first episode Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire production was delayed and overhauled after a workprint1 had been poorly received and covered 70 of the episode This share of the episode had to be remade and rewritten while airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire for it being a Christmas special having to air it in Christmas 1989 and becoming the first episode during this hiatus the first episode in broadcasting order and the first episode of the series instead</td>\n",

       "0   Homer hastily drives the Family Sedan with Marge and Maggie through a snowcovered street They are late for Bart and Lisas Christmas pageant at Springfield Elementary School After crashing into a pile of snow at the front of Springfield Elementary School park Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduce the second grade The children do a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world such as Ralph Wiggum as Hotei Oshō Dewey Largo introduces Lisa playing Tawanga the Santa Claus of the South Seas Lisa’s dance causes awe throughout the crowd Lisa performs a skilled dance with lit torches performing tricks such as throwing it around herself – Lisa also wears seethrough clothing effectively ‘revealing Lisa completely at the end of her act Skinner eventually introduces the fourth grade singing Christmas carols Jingle Bells is sung first and after the first verse Bart picks up his voice volume during the chorus and sings a Batmanthemed parody causing an irate Skinner to withdraw Bart from the performance Homer gives a disappointed look for Barts actions but as the pageant continues he grows bored and wonders aloud how long the pageant will lastAt the Simpson family home Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards as Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names and stories Marge soon stops writing due to Homers grumpy demeanor Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists Marge is uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover future costs Bart then undergoes a “James Bond”style operation Back at home Lisa tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out Marge tells him to calm down and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus further for the year Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk choosing to conceal the truth Once outside he looks at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair on the sidewalkMarge senses something is amiss with Homer and asks if there is something wrong Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping so she doesnt have to Marge agrees and is content with Homers answer the two sleep The next day Homer does the Christmas shopping alone at Circus of Values He purchases pantyhose for Marge pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie While purchasing such dismal presents Homer uses empty optimism to assure his own self On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned and Todd while he carries an armful of fancily wrapped packages All the presents are spilled onto the ground and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought Ned attempts to sort the presents unintentionally gloating his wealth At Moes Tavern Homer drinks a beer alone when a cheerful Barney arrives wearing a Santa Claus costume Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a parttime job acting as a department store Santa at the mall Homer suddenly has an idea so he goes to the personnel office in the mall where he fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa After he finishes reviewing Homers application as well as interviewing him the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues with the Hypnotist as the teacherHomer finally gets home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been Homer assures the insignificance of his tardiness and heads upstairs but Marge tells him they have guests Patty and Selma As Homer talks to Patty and Selma they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet Homer gives false information and tells them he was about to leave and he rushes out the door In the car Homer drives past several Christmas tree lots gradually the trees become cheaper from the earlier expensive ones Eventually he stops at a private Christmas Tree Farm and uses a chainsaw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family Homer is soon met with retaliation the farm owner fires his gun upon Homer and has two hounds pursue However Homer escapes relatively easily Back at home Homer stands up the tree and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma On Christmas Eve at the mall Homer works as Santa Claus while children wait in line to sit on his lap one being a very greedy child From a distance Bart Milhouse and Lewis watch the children line up to sit on Santas lap while they comment on the gullibility of the kids Milhouse dares Bart to yank off Santas beard and Bart agrees Bart jumps in line and finally gets his turn on Santas lap Not knowing that Santa is really Homer Bart yanks off his beard Bart is surprised at what he uncovers and Homer escorts Bart into Santas workshop for speaking in private leaving Alfie to cover for him Homer explains the situation to Bart who understands and feels terrible for pulling Homers beard offBart goes with Homer as he picks up his check Homer is surprised to learn that his net pay is only 13 despite his 120 gross pay When he questions the cashier she explains the majority of his check went to pay for the Santa suit and beard social security unemployment insurance training and Christmas club account balance While a depressed Homer sits down to figure out what to do with the 13 an excited Barney tells Homer that he is going to the Springfield Downs to place a bet with his earnings He invites Homer to come along with him ensuring a win on the dog Whirlwind Homer is reluctant but Bart convinces him to go citing that this might be their only chance to save the Simpson family ChristmasPatty Selma Abe Simpson Marge Maggie and Lisa wait for Homer and Bart to come home while watching a The Happy Little Elves Christmas special Meanwhile at the dog track Barney insists Homer should bet on Whirlwind After seeing what Whirlwind looks like Homer is reluctant to bet on him Just then an announcement plays over the PA system a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing Sir Galahad in the fourth race Bart senses that the announcement is an omen and chooses to ask Homer to bet on him and despite the fact that the odds are ninetynine to one which means that the dogs winning chances are extremely rare Homer puts down all 13 on Santas Little Helper Meanwhile at home Patty and Selma talk bad about Homer while everyone waits for him and Bart Lisa then explains to Patty how her bad mouthing will damage herself confusing Patty Back at the track Homer and Bart anxiously await the running of the fourth race As the race begins Homer and Bart cheer on Santas Little Helper but Whirlwind Barneys pick is out to an early lead with Santas Little Helper bringing up the rear Homer and Bart quickly realize their chances at winning any money are dashed as Santas Little Helper finishes lastHomer and Bart look for discarded betting slips hoping to find one that has been thrown away with a winner but to no avail A dejected Bart and Homer head back to their car when off in the distance they see Les a racing dog owner scolding Santas Little Helper and sending him away for losing once again Santas Little Helper leaps up into Homers arms Bart asks Homer if they can keep the dog Homer reluctant at first quickly warms up to the dog and plans to take him home Back at the Simpson home while everyone still awaits Bart and Homers return a sadlooking Homer arrives and starts to confess to everyone about the fact that he didnt receive his Christmas bonus and apologizes for the lack of presents However Bart interrupts Homer by introducing the family to Santas Little Helper and watches the hound run into the room barking Everyone ignores Homer and falls in love with Santas Little Helper Marge forgives Homer and he realizes that in the end he has done a good job providing gifts at Christmas for the Simpson family A photo of the happy family is then takenDuring the closing credits the Simpson family begin singing Rudolph The RedNosed Reindeer while Maggie is riding on Santas Little Helper At the end of a few stanzas Homer scolds Bart and Lisa for ruining the song such as calling out Like a lightbulb Homer eventually sings Rudolph get your nose over here so you can guide my sleigh today However in the end Bart interrupts once again causing Homer to strangle Bart while shouting Why you littleSimpsons Roasting on an Open FireTranscriptThe Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the episode finished thirtieth in the week of December 11–17 1989 It concluded with a Nielsen rating of 145 and was viewed in approximately 134 million homes  \n",

                     The Simpson family is playing Scrabble in the living room in an effort to build Bart’s vocabulary for his aptitude test the next day at school Bart however hates the game so he ends it when he cheats and makes up an imaginary word “Kwyjibo” Before he leaves Homer roughly grabs Bart and accuses him of cheating He then forces him to define Kwyjibo Bart eventually defines it as “A big dumb balding North American ape with no chin” Marge adds minor detail to the definition of Kwyjibo with and a short temper This causes Homer to become instantly angered and chases Bart out of the room as Bart replies Uhoh Kwyjibo on the looseThe next day before class in the schoolyard Bart is spraypainting graffiti that defames Principal Skinner on the school building Principal Skinner is watching the kids on the playground Martin Prince the school genius tattles about the graffiti Milhouse one of Barts friends sees Martin informing Skinner and warns Bart Skinner arrives where Bart Milhouse and two more children are feigning their involvement He then checks each of their hands but Bart is caught redhanded Skinner orders Bart to see him after schoolAs the children file into class Martin encounters Bart in the classroom explaining that he feels apologetic for Bart and merely was attempting to prevent the desecration of the school but Bart rebuffs Martin by replying Eat my shorts Mrs Krabappel hands out aptitude tests to everyone When she instructs the class on taking the timed intelligence test Martin raises his hand and reminds her that Bart is supposed to face the window during any test so he can’t cheat A grumbling Bart turns his desk to face the window and the test begins In an attempt to figure out a lengthy math word problem Bart tries to quietly read the problem so he can solve it Mrs Krabappel reminds him for visualization instead The visualization turns into a daydream and when Bart finally comes back to reality Martin announces that he has finished his test already Mrs Krabappel allows Martin go outside to read a book during the remainder of the testing period While Bart is still taking his test he looks out the window to see a smug Martin sticking his tongue out at him In retaliation Bart sticks his tongue out and makes faces back at Martin after Martin does the same Mrs Krabappel spots Bart making faces and looks out the window to see what Bart is looking at While her back is turned Bart who is seated at the front of the class reaches over to Mrs Krabappel’s desk and steals Martin’s test replaces Martin’s name with his own and then puts the test back on her desk Bart then quickly fills out random answers on his own test and then writes Martin’s name at the top and turns it inLater after school Marge and Homer are called to Principal Skinner’s office for a meeting about Bart’s behavior at school Skinner informs Marge and Homer about Bart’s graffiti from earlier that morning As he reaches for Bart’s rather extensive permanent record and is about to suggest something along the lines of expulsion for Bart his secretary buzzes in and says that Dr J Loren Pryor the school counselor is waiting to see him Dr Pryor walks in on the meeting and surprises everyone when he tells them that Bart is a “gifted child” and according to the aptitude test from earlier Bart has an IQ of 216 Dr Pryor suggests that Bart’s history of bad behavior stems from a lack of interest in his school work due to the fact that it is too easy for him Skinner wants Bart retested but when Dr Pryor suggests moving Bart to a school for gifted children Skinner jumps on board with the idea and Bart quickly agrees when he hears that the school doesn’t have much structure and that you get to make your own rules Dr Pryor hands Bart some paperwork for the “gifted children” school and he Homer and Marge leave the meeting stunnedThe next morning at the breakfast table Marge and Homer hover around their new genius child and Homer tells Lisa to start eating what Bart eats for breakfast so she can become a genius too However Lisa is not fooled by Bart and knows that he is still just a dimwit After breakfast Homer takes Bart to the “Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children” Once inside the school they find Bart’s class and after peeking in they see that all the boys are wearing ties So Homer gives Bart the tie he is wearing and he gives Bart a little pep talk about his first day at the new school and shoves him in the classroom door Once inside the class Ms Mellon the teacher introduces herself and the new classmates to Bart and shows him around the classroom She tells Bart about the independent learning and that the only rule is for him to make his own rules Class begins with a debate on the topic of free will and the paradoxes that it creates Bart struggles to understand the discussion Later at lunch Bart’s classmates realize that Bart isn’t really that smart when he accepts their ridiculously uneven trade offers Ex 1000 picoliters of milk for four gills worth A gill is much much larger than a picoliter A dejected Bart walks away from the lunch table as the other kids laugh at himAfter school Bart relaxes in his room when Homer walks in to see about Bart’s first day at the new school Homer suggests they all go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes and Bart agrees Just then Marge walks by and tells Homer and Bart that she bought tickets to the opera in an effort to try to help nurture Bart’s brain Later during the opera a bored and impatient Homer and Bart goof off and cut each other up even though they are continually shushed by an upset Marge The next day at school Bart feels even more stupid and left out when he can’t understand a calculus problem on the chalkboard Later as a sad Bart walks home from school he passes by the playground of his old school where Richard Lewis and Milhouse are shooting marbles When Bart greets them and tries to talk to them they treat him like a nerd call him names and tell him to get lost Cut to later at dinner as a depressed Bart eats Marge reminds everyone that they can’t be late for the film festival that she bought tickets for as another way to nurture Bart’s brain Bart is reluctant to go to the festival and Homer tells him they don’t have to Just as Bart is about to tell Homer what is on his mind and confess about the false IQ test Homer insists on going outside to play catch After playing catch Bart sees how much being a genius means to Homer and chooses not to confess about what he has done out of fear of disappointing himThe next day at the “gifted children” school while performing a chemistry experiment Bart accidentally causes an explosion which results in green goo everywhere Later at Dr Pyror’s office a greenstained Bart meets with Dr Pyror They discuss the reasoning behind his recent failings at the new school and Dr Pyror thinks that once again Bart isn’t being challenged enough while Bart suggests that he just go back to Springfield Elementary When Dr Pryor wants to know why Bart makes up an excuse and tells Dr Pryor he would like to go undercover and study regular kids and their school environment “to see what makes ‘em tick” Dr Pryor agrees and tells Bart to write up a proposal to present to Principal Skinner while he goes to talk to him Bart struggles to write a proposal and instead changes his mind and writes his confession When Dr Pryor comes back in the office and reads Bart’s confession he suddenly realizes that Bart misspelled confessionLater at home a still greenstained Bart greets his parents and Homer offers to give Bart a turpentine bath to wash off the green Out in the backyard as Homer gives Bart a bath Bart confesses about cheating on the aptitude test and tells Homer that he loves him and that he has enjoyed the extra attention from being a “genius” He tells Homer that he doesn’t think something that has brought them closer than they ever were before could be bad which angers Homer and he chases Bart out of the tub trying to choke him for telling him that Fortunately Bart is too fast for Homer and runs into his bedroom and locks the door Then Homer pounds on Bart’s door and tries to coax him to come out claiming he cant hug and kiss him But Bart claims that while he might not be a genius he is not THAT dumb and claims to be insulted Everything is back to normal in the Simpson home as Homer gets mad and pounds on Barts doorBart the GeniusTranscriptThis episode marked the first time that the opening sequence was used which was different from the second season

class including Bart and prepares them for a field trip to the nuclear power plant Otto the bus driver pulls up to the curb and Bart chats with him outside of the bus deleted scene sometimes as the other kids find their seats Mrs Krabappel yells at Bart to get on the bus When he scurries to find a seat he is bummed to see the only one left is right next to Wendell the White Boy who is always queasy and pukes on every bus ride As Otto takes the long way to the power plant Bart struggles to behave on the bus ride Mrs Krabappel warns Bart that one more outburst will result in him singing to the class at the front of the bus Sherri and Terri who are sitting behind Bart plan to get him in some more trouble At the same time the twins kiss Bart on the cheek causing him to yell out Mrs Krabappel asks Bart why cant he be more like Sherri and Terri and then makes good on her threat and forces Bart to sing in front of the class The bus finally arrives at the power plant and Bart congratulates Wendell for making the entire bus ride without getting sick by slapping him on the back which results in the latter puking anywayOnce inside the plant Mr Smithers shows a film on nuclear energy in a small theater The film stars Smilin’ Joe Fission a little animated character who explains the ins and outs of nuclear energy After the film Smithers gives a tour of the plant As the children walk behind and listen Sherri and Terri tell Bart about how their dad who also works at the power plant says that Homer is an incompetent worker Cut to Homer who is sitting in a small motorized cart with his feet propped up and eating a doughnut Homer comments to a coworker that Bart’s class will be here any minute and he drives off in search of him The kids continue their tour while walking on a catwalk above the working area of the plant Just then Homer turns the corner in his cart underneath Bart and the other kids Bart observes Homer and calls out to him as Homer looks up to wave back at Bart he does not pay attention to where he is going and crashes into a vent pipe causing it to leak dangerous gas The supervisor nearby who happens to be Sherri and Terri’s father demands to understand who caused the accident When all the workers point at Homer the supervisor tells Homer he is fired He then looks up and sees his twin daughters and waves and they wave back as a humiliated Bart hides his faceThe next morning at breakfast everyone gives words of encouragement to a depressed Homer on finding a new job After hearing what they all have to say a reenergized Homer heads out to find a job But after a long day of doors slammed in his face and no new job prospects Homer relieves his stress at Moe’s Tavern As Homer drinks a beer the phone rings Moe answers it and it is Bart playing a prank phone call Homer reaches for his wallet to buy another beer only to discover that he doesn’t have any more money and when Moe won’t run Homer a tab Homer heads for home Later that night in bed with Marge Homer expresses his concerns about finding another job Marge consoles him and tells Homer that for the time being she can go back to the old job she had before they got married as a rollerskating waitressThe next day with Marge gone at work a depressed and unresponsive Homer lies on the couch Even when the kids try to cheer him up he does not respond or move Later that night after seeing a Duff beer commercial Homer finally gets up from the couch Homer wanders into the kitchen and searches the fridge for a beer he becomes enraged when he can’t find one He heads up to Bart’s room and while Bart sleeps Homer steals his piggy bank Back downstairs in the kitchen Homer smashes open Bart’s piggy bank only to find that Bart doesn’t even have enough money for just one beer Homer suddenly realizes what he has done and how low he has sunk and plans to solve his problems by committing suicide Homer writes the family a farewell note and heads outside In the backyard with intentions of jumping off a bridge Homer ties one end of a rope around his waist and the other end around a large boulder A tearful Homer looks back at the house one last time and then struggles down the road alone with the boulder in his armsHomer continues on his journey to the bridge while back at the house Bart and Lisa rush in to Marge’s room and wake her up telling her they’ve been robbed Bart thinks they have been robbed because his piggy bank is stolen but then Lisa discovers Homer’s note and everyone gasps Cut back to Homer as he nears the bridge he crosses an intersection without a stop sign and is nearly struck by an oncoming car Homer continues on to the bridge where he finds an identical boulder to the one hes just carried across town and just as he is about to jump into the water below Marge and the kids running behind Homer shout from a distance and tell him to stop As they rush over to Homer they cross the intersection and are also nearly hit by a car But Homer quickly runs in and pushes them out of the way He comments on how dangerous the intersection is and how someone should put a stop sign there Suddenly a light goes on in Homer’s head and he realizes that he now has a purpose in life to make the intersection saferThe next day at City Hall Homer presents his proposal for a stop sign at 12th and D Street the dangerous intersection His proposal is accepted and a stunned Homer feels a greater sense of purpose and chooses to go on a campaign to make all of Springfield safer A montage of newspaper headlines ensues chronicling all of Homer’s new signs and his growing public support Later the next week after the town has been covered with safety signs Homer still feels he must do more and plans to take on the nuclear power plant and attempt to make it safer The next day at the power plant in front of a large cheering crowd Homer stages a protest about the lack of safety at the power plant Mr Burns glowers down at the protest from high above through his office window and orders Smithers to bring Homer to him to talk privately Smithers goes down to the protest retrieves Homer and sends him to Mr Burns’ office Once inside Mr Burns offers Homer a new job at the plant as the safety inspector which would have a considerably larger salary than his old job as a technical supervisor Homer mulls over the job offer and accepts Mr Burns tells Homer that his first duty is to step out on the balcony and lie to the crowd and tell them the power plant is safe Homer reluctantly steps on the balcony to lie to the crowd and suddenly has a change of mind he heads back into Burns’ office and tells him he can’t do it Burns realizes that Homer is very passionate about safety and won’t back down to anything he keeps Homer on as the safety inspector anyway Homer goes back out to the balcony to announce to everyone his new job the crowd cheers and Homer does a celebratory dance on the balcony ledge However Homer the safety inspector himself falls off the balcony The crowd catches him below and they carry him off on their shoulders chanting his name and finishing the episodeHomers OdysseyTranscriptThe cartoon at the power plant was given an oldtime reel footage feel by having the animation cels dragged across a cement floor to scratch it up This trick was used several more times by the animators until the show abandoned animation cels in 2002This episode marks the first appearance of Mr Smithers He was AfricanAmerican instead of yellow According to David Silverman Gyorgi Peluci the color stylist randomly planned the ethnicity of various characters which usually wasnt much of a problem but it sort of ruined the white sycophant personality for Smithers In his next appearance he was colored right but still with blue hair Although Mr Burns was seen in Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire this was his first appearance in order of production codes as well as the first use of his name hence the dramatic music when the camera pans out on himWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood the authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide stated that the story rather fizzles out at the end but there are many good moments especially in the power plant  \n",

He tells them to get the bad behavior out of their system because they are going to Mr Burns’ company picnic and he doesn’t want his family to embarrass him in front of Mr Burns When the family arrives at Mr Burns mansion for the picnic Homer once again reminds his family that they have to behave in a normal manner Bart and Lisa quickly run off to play in the water fountain and Homer chases

man from the “perfect” family ahead of him and tells him he can stop the fake cornball routine However the man reveals his family are actually nice normal people in real life and dont act like this only at gatherings When the man admits pitying him Homer finally realizes the truththat his own family has a problem He watches a son from the normal family lets his sister enter the back seat like a

drive home The man politely refuses and starts the car Homer then turns his attention to Marge whos still intoxicated and asking him to drive home before she throws up in his car He imagines the mans family driving off to Heaven while he is driving his own family in Hell Homer goes back home in his reality now knowing how much Marge Bart and Lisa embarrassed him in front of his bossThe next day Marge and the kids eat TV dinners in the living room and watch TV together when Homer walks in and plans that tonight they are all going to eat at the dinner table like a normal family At the dinner table the rest of the Simpsons are not taking Homers attempt to get them to eat like a normal family seriously and continue eating like cavemen During his prayer Homer expresses his dissatisfaction with his troubled familys behavior and ponders why he was cursed with those who disrespect him When Marge and the kids claim there is nothing is wrong with the family Homer chooses to prove that there is something wrong with them He leads the family in a tour around the neighborhood peeking into random houses to observe their neighbors’ normal family life However the rest of the Simpsons are unnerved by Homers sudden rash behavior in the tour and tries to convince him that theyre normal like everyone else who have familiar problems like them He refuses to believe them pointing out that normal families converses with each other about their day and eat at the dinner table not ignore a family member and eating dinner while watching TV in the living room A neighbor notices Homer spying on his family and fires warning rounds from his shotgun By the time they got back to the safety of their house Marge tells him off that she thinks the trip is unnecessary because she and the kids feel like stalkers invading their entire neighborhoods privacies with their families They quickly retreat back inside to continue watching TVDepressed by this matter Homer visits Moes Tavern for a drink and to get away from his problems Two patrolmen enter the bar claiming they received reports of a neighborhood stalker The dog suspects Homer and growls at them to pay attention Luckily for him the two cops are too dumb to notice anything and drag the dog away After getting into a brief fight with Barney Homer later sees a commercial for Dr Marvin Monroes Family Therapy Center Dr Monroe guarantees family bliss or double your money back Homer then gets an idea to make his family normalMarge and the kids watch an Itchy  Scratchy cartoon when Homer walks in the living room and announces he has made an appointment at Dr Monroe’s Family Therapy Center The family is reluctant to the idea but Homer is on a mission to make his family better Marge tries to claim that theres still nothing wrong with their family but Homer doesnt listen In order to raise the 250 needed for the session Homer pawns the TV much to the rest of the familys horrorThe therapy treatment begins as Dr Monroe brings them into another room and sits them down He encourages them each to draw a picture that represents the source of their unhappiness Most of the Simpsons vent their anger out by drawing Homer as they see him while Homer gets lost in the exercise by drawing airplanes dropping bombs on his family When Dr Monroe sees this he points out to Homer that had he been paying attention he wouldve known his family sees him as an abusive and stern disciplinarian Monroe also calls him an ogre a word that Marge and Lisa disagree with claiming ogre is too much Bart agrees with Monroe making Homer furious enough to attack him Dr Monroe calms Homer down and asks the family to try different exercises such as the foam padded aversion mallets that Bart turns into a hard weapon by removing the foam padding from his mallet and striking Dr Monroe with it Soon Dr Monroe sees that the Simpson family is not responding to conventional treatment so his next exercise becomes different He places each of the Simpsons in their own chair hooked up to deliver an electric shock Each chair has buttons that when pressed will deliver an electric shock to another corresponding chair With all of the Simpsons strapped in Dr Monroe instructs them only to shock someone else if that person hurts them emotionally However the family members quickly start shocking each other over minor slights and then things go totally off the rails when Maggie starts hitting all the buttons at random leading to a power brownout across the entire city much to Mr Burns joy as this increased use of electricity means more money for his companyDr Monroe soon tires of the Simpsons and unplugs the generator He tells them that theyre beyond his help and orders them to leave but Homer refuses reminding Monroe of his doublemoney back guarantee Dr Monroe grudingly agrees and furiously hands over 500 while ordering them to leave and never tell anyone they were ever there The family leaves more than satisfied given their unexpected windfall and cannot help but feel more united Homer decides to use the money to buy a brand new TV and the Simpsons happily head homeTheres No Disgrace Like HomeTranscriptThe episode shows telltale signs of being one of the earliest shows of the season produced The characters act slightly different from how they would in later seasons For example Lisa is an undisciplined brat Marge is a drunk and inattentive whereas Homer is concerned and the voice of reason for his family It was an early episode for Mr Burns in which he had a voice different from the one it would later become Originally the character was influenced by Ronald Reagan which was later dropped The idea that he would greet his employees using index cards was inspired by how Ronald Reagan would greet people The episode marks the first time Burns says release the hounds It also marked the first appearance of Eddie and Lou although Lou was not black but instead yellow like the rest of the characters Lou was named after Lou Whitaker  a former Major League Baseball player It is the first appearance of Itchy  Scratchy although the cat and mouse duo appeared in the shortsThe idea behind the scene in which the family take turns to electrically shock each other was based on Laurel and Hardy throwing pies at each other albeit played out more sadistically The scene was rearranged in the editing room because when it was first produced it played out differently The edits made to the finished product were preliminary however they were received well and remained unchangedBurns and SmithersThis episode marks the introduction of Dr Marvin Monroe Itchy and Scratchy and Eddie and Lou two of Springfields policemen Lou was colored yellow by mistake in this episode same mistake made in Krusty Gets Busted though he is later an AfricanAmerican and Smithers who was drawn as an AfricanAmerican in the previous episode is drawn in yellow a shade or two lighter than Burns in this one This episode also marks the first use of Burns release the hounds commentThe authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood note Its very strange to see Homer pawning the TV set in an attempt to save the family if this episode had come later Marge would surely have taken this stance They continue A neat swipe at family counseling with some great set pieces were especially fond of the perfect version of the Simpsons and the electricshock aversion therapy In a DVD review of the first season David B Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2050 placing it as one of the worst of the seasonThis episode would have been one of the first seen by British viewers It was the first episode to be broadcast by the BBC on November 23 1996 on a Saturday at 530pm because the episodes were shown out of order The episode was screened with five million viewers that was slightly less than the show Dads Army a British series revolving around a misfit military platoon which previously held the timeslot The episode also faced competition from ITVs screening of Sabrina the Teenage Witch This was unless you had a subscription to SKY TV in the 90s as they showed the episodes in order from September 2 1990 the first being The Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire It was said to be the savior of Sky TV from being an instant failureThe scene where the family turn electrically shocking each other would later appear in the film Die Hard 2 Die Harder  \n",

Inside the classroom a worried Bart imagines about the showdown with Nelson after school where there is nothing Bart can do to defeat NelsonIn the lunchroom everyone hails Bart as a hero A modest and nervous Bart downplays the situation Nelson walks up to a trembling Bart to remind him about the fight after school Back in the classroom Bart daydreams again this time about his own funeral in which his family mourns him especially Homer who has then grown a conscience and realized that his son was more important than work Lisa places a cupcake on Bart reflecting on how the fight was her responsibility Nelson notices this and pounds him one last time Back in reality after school a nervous Bart darts around the playground hoping to avoid Nelson Bart turns a corner only to see Nelson standing right in front of him Nelson promptly pummels Bart throws him in a rubbish bin and informs Bart to meet again tomorrow after school for another beatingNelson bleeds from his confrontation with BartThe garbage bin with Bart inside rolls to a stop in front of the Simpson house and a weary Bart stumbles out and goes inside the house Once inside Bart walks past his parents in the living room and heads to the bathroom to cry Marge sends Homer in to console Bart Marge eavesdrops on the conversation and when it is revealed that Nelson is picking on Bart she bursts in and gives Bart advice She advises him to talk nicely to Nelson and try to settle things like gentlemen Homer disagrees and takes Bart into another room and shows him how to fight Simpsons style ie dirtyThe next day after school in the schoolyard Bart uses Homers advice and flings mud in Nelsons eye which only makes Nelson furious Nelson beats up Bart again and shaves his hat into his mouth off screen throws him into another bin and rolls it away Once again in front of the Simpson house the bin rolls to a stop Lisa is sitting out on the sidewalk and suggests Bart seek Grandpa Simpsons adviceBart goes to the retirement home and visits Grandpa Grandpa tells Bart to just stand up for himself An elderly neighbor named Jasper enters Grandpas room and demands Grandpas newspaper Grandpa says no and stands up for himself The two have a tugofwar over the newspaper and Jasper wins Realizing that Bart standing up for himself might not work Grandpa says he is friends with someone who can help Grandpa and Bart go over to Hermans Military Antiques to ask Herman for advice Herman tells them Bart needs to start a small army and they begin to devise a planBart the GeneralAt school a note is passed around class The note tells the kids that anyone fed up with Nelson should meet at Barts tree house after school Inside the tree house a group of kids along with Herman and Grandpa wait for Bart to arrive Bart stumbles in after being beaten up again as well as coughing up his hat and rallies the recruits and encourages them to join in his battle plan against Nelson A montage of army marches drills obstacle courses and training with Bart as the drill sergeant commences Back inside the tree house days later the battle plan is being finalised by Bart Lisa Herman and Grandpa Milhouse steps in and informs Bart of Nelsons whereabouts and the battle plan begins Outside on the streets Bart confronts Nelson and out of nowhere Barts army appears with water balloons much to Nelsons surprise Water bombing takes place and Nelson is captured Bart wheels a tied up Nelson in a wagon back to the Simpson house Bart tells Nelson that he hopes he has learned his lesson and reaches to untie him but Nelson says as soon as he is free he is going to pound BartInside the Simpson house Herman draws up a peace treaty between Bart and Nelson which they both sign Marge steps in and hands out cupcakes everyone In the conclusion of the episode Bart sits on a table in a library and finishes the episode by telling the viewers about the seriousness of warThis is the first episode to not feature a chalkboard gag or a couch gag since the episode’s running time was too long to use the normal opening sequence Instead they just cut to an image of the Simpson house David Silverman was the director and was kind of stressed because he was doing storyboards for this episode while also directing Bart the Genius Originally he had planned to use the song “War” by Edwin Starr in the episode The plans were dropped when they agreed that the song did not really fit the story The episode had problems with the censors who did not want the characters to say family jewels on prime time television The producers ignored the notes and family jewels remained in the episodeTwo new characters were introduced in this episode The first one is Nelson Muntz who remains a commonly used recurring character The second is Herman who has been used less The design of Herman except for only having one arm was inspired by the look of the writer John Swartzwelder The voice was partly inspired by George H W Bush and performed by Harry Shearer The original idea with Herman was that every time he would be shown he would have a different story to why he only has one armMatt Groening notes on the commentary track that he finds it strange how controversial this episode seemed at the time of its release Today they would go a lot further and to him this episode now seems harmless The authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood said Some good lines and set pieces aside  we love Barts fantasy of death at Nelsons hands  this episode nevertheless feels a bit unsure of itself particularly towards the end In a DVD review of the first season David B Grelck gave the episode a rating of 35 and adds Another episode that helped to propel Barts popularity into the stratosphereBart the General and Seinfelds The Tape were used in a Dartmouth College experiment to study brain activity in relation to humorous moments in television shows The results were published in a 2004 issue of the academic journal Neurological The researchers noted During moments of humor detection significant brain activation was noted in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus  and left inferior frontal gyros  \n",

door waiting for his turn Later in the kitchen before going to work Homer searches for his keys while Bart and Lisa eat breakfast before school Lisa finds the keys still in the front door Marge has only two cupcakes for Homer Bart and Lisa however Lisa defers the cupcakes to Homer and Bart as she is clearly depressed Her depression causes her to not show any effort in band practice in lunch during a food fight and in the gym After school in the living room Bart and Homer play a boxing video game called Super Slugfest Homer suffers his 49th consecutive loss at the hands of Bart while Marge shows Homer a note from school about Lisa with Homer initially assuming the note was about Bart and Bart trying to deny it until to even Barts surprise Marge revealed it wasnt referring to Bart Lisa and MurphyThe note is a progress report from Principal Skinner informing Homer and Marge that Lisa was too sad to play dodge ball at school Homer attempts to discover the cause of Lisa’s sadness and she tells him she wonders if the world would be any different if she didn’t exist When Homer clearly can’t come up with a good quick answer Marge tells Lisa to take a hot bath and Homer tells Bart to vacuum the floor When Lisa is done with her bath she walks into the living room where Bart is still vacuuming and is not happy about it Maggie sits by herself on the couch watching Bart and Lisa In an effort to see who Maggie likes more both Bart and Lisa coax her to each other instead Maggie chooses the TV Later Homer and Bart are playing Super Slugfest again where Bart easily wins again for the 50th time Homer blames the loss on Lisa’s loud saxophone playing Homer goes up to Lisa’s room to yell at her but accidentally makes her cry as he apologizes for yelling at her Lisa agrees to just practice on playing the notes without blowing into the saxophone After Homer leaves the room Lisa hears a saxophone playing off in the distance outside her window and leaves the house to go find the source Lisa walks through the town at nighttime and discovers a man playing a saxophone alone on a bridge overpassBack at the Simpson house everyone is asleep and Marge dreams about her childhood In the dream Marge is a sad little girl and before going out to play her mother tells her to make sure she smiles Homer also has a dream that he is trapped inside the boxing video game with Bart Bart KO’s Homer and he wakes up screaming from his nightmare Marge expresses her concern with Lisa’s sadness to Homer Meanwhile Lisa is jamming with the man who introduces himself as Bleeding Gums Murphy

gloats to Homer and Bart In an effort to try to keep up with Ned Homer takes the family to Bobs RV RoundUp in search of an RV of their own Bob the RV salesman comes out and introduces Homer to an RV called the Ultimate Behemoth and gives the family a tour During the tour Homer and the kids express their awe of the RV whereas Marge worries about the cost and is constantly ignored by Bob when she asks for the price tag on the RV presumably aware that she knows her family cant afford it Convinced in wanting to buy the RV to one up Flanders Homer asks him for the price Bob takes him into the office and goes over the rules He reveals that though he owns the place Bob still has to run a credit check on his computer for business and security protocol before they can proceed with the deal for the Ultimate Behemoth A siren alerts him but Homer assumes its sound means he has been approved However Bob tells Homer that hes been rejected and it was the computers way of warning the owner not to proceed with the deal It turns out the Ultimate Behemoth is out of Homers price range due to his poor credit rating In desperation he begs Bob to show him an RV that isnt out of his price range and says he doesnt want to go home empty handed So he shows Homer the most run down beaten up and smallest RV on the lot Marge Lisa and Bart shows their disapproval of the RV as it is too used and dilapidated They attempt to get him to refuse and leave empty handed However Homer ignores his familys warning and gives into Bobs pressure in buying the dilapidated RVLater after loading up their brand new RV Homer gloats to Flanders about his purchase and the Simpson family head out on an excursion to go camping On the way Homer makes an unwise decision to take a less beaten path instead of staying on the interstate Marge suspects something is wrong and advises Homer to stop and turn back However he ignores Marge when she suggests they look at the map or stopping for directions Calling his RV an allterrainvehicle and much to the worry of everyone else Homer plows through a forest and chooses to stop randomly in the middle of nowhere When the RV finally comes to a screeching halt it ends up teetering over a precipice The Simpsons bail out of the RV and it plummets over the edge and explodes at the bottomThe family is now left with nothing but the clothes on their backs and they are lost in the middle of the forest Homer tells everyone to relax because he is an experienced woodsman Yeah right Homer He then builds a makeshift shelter for Marge Lisa and Maggie and takes Bart along with him to find help Marge and Lisa watch as Maggie follows behind Homer and Bart however they are not aware of Maggie behind them When Homer and Bart hear Maggie sucking on her pacifier they think it is a rattle snake and take off running scared leaving Maggie far behind Homer and Bart then stumble through some brush and end up falling off another cliff and into a raging river below Meanwhile Marge and Lisa seem to be just fine They are tidying up their camp and have built a much better shelter for themselves It seems that Marge and Lisa are more experienced in camping than Homer is Cut to Maggie who has been left all alone a bear approaches her on its hind legs and roars Maggie unafraid sticks an extra pacifier in the bears mouth which calms the bear down After Homer and Bart fall down a waterfall Homer sees Barts lucky cap float by and assumes Bart has drowned but is relieved to see Bart alive and they both realize they are now naked after falling over the waterfall Back to Maggie who is being carried by the bear back to its cave where she is accepted as one of the group by three other bears Meanwhile Homer and Bart look for food after clothing themselves with shrubbery Homers attempts at catching rabbits for food fail Back to Maggie the bears find another family of campers and steal things from their site like a bottle and baby toys and bring them back to Maggie Meanwhile it is nighttime and Marge and Lisa have made themselves a fire and get ready for bed while miles away Homer and Bart shiver without a fire and try to go to sleep and Maggie is sleeping warmly with her new family of bearsThe next morning Homer and Bart look for food and come across a bee hive When Homer steals some honey the bees attack him but he evades them and jumps into a muddy stream where a naturalist cameraman is filming footage of a deer The cameraman runs off scared after seeing Homer covered in mud and screaming incoherently due to the big glob of honey still in his mouth Cut to a breaking news report claiming the existence of Bigfoot and using the footage of Homer as proof A 5000 reward is offered for Bigfoots capture The next day at the edge of the forest Bigfoot mania has set in people are selling Bigfoot memorabilia and the press is everywhere covering the event Marge and Lisa who have been found by a park ranger are surprised to see all the excitement and they realize it is Homer and not Bigfoot everyone is after Meanwhile Homer still covered with mud and Bart accidentally come across the bear cave with Maggie inside Just before the bears are about to maul Homer and Bart Maggie communicates to the bears that it is okay Homer takes Maggie back and along with Bart they wander back out into the woods After awhile Homer is spotted in the forest by hunters looking for Bigfoot and is shot with a tranquilizer gun After being tested and studied Homer is released to go back home Dr Marvin Monroe announces at a press conference that the evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not Homer is Bigfoot Homer and Marge watch the press conference just before going to bed and Marge consoles a crestfallen Homer who is worried about the teasing he is going to receive at workIn the episodes original American broadcast on February 18th 1990 the episode finished third that day with a Nielsen rating of 146 and 22 percent audience share The Call of the Simpsons received mixed reviews from critics Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood authors of the book I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide both criticized and praised the episode saying This episode is a bit less than the sum of its parts The early stuff at the RV RoundUp is much better than the main camping story although theres some nice MargeLisa bonding and who could resist Maggie and the bears  \n",

sidewalk in downtown Springfield at nighttime Bart has the head of a statue in his arms As the pair turn the corner a furious mob advances on them Homer and Bart are forced to turn and flee Then the mob corners Homer and Bart in the town square next to the headless Jebediah Springfield statue As the mob slowly advances Bart climbs onto the statue and begs everyone to listen to his storyWhile the rest of the family prepare to go to church Homer is preoccupied with a football game On the way into church Marge confiscates Barts portable radio with earphones and gives them to Homer During Sunday school the teacher and students discuss the topic of who is allowed in Heaven Back in the church the sermon is about sports gambling Homer is oblivious because he is using Barts headphones to listen to the game On the way home from church Marge expresses her disapproval of Homers headphones and Bart sees that the movie theater is playing “Space Mutants 4” As Bart wants to see it Homer doesnt care but Marge refuses Homer gives Bart 5 and he heads to the theater on his skateboard Upon arrival he encounters Jimbo Dolph and Kearney When Bart makes a good impression on Jimbo the trio invite him to sneak into Space Mutants 4 with themAfter the manager finds and kicks the four out of the movie theater for not paying they go to KwikEMart where Jimbo Dolph and Kearney shoplift several goods as Bart buys Squishees to distract Apu Bart meets with them in the parking lot and realizes he was used as a distraction to help them steal from the store and in an effort to stay cool with the group he doesnt say anything They wander over to the town square to throw rocks at the statue of the towns founder Jebediah Springfield Once again Bart goes along with the group so they will like him After throwing the rock Mr Dandy tells them off and the four are scared away Later while the group lays at the Grassy Hilled Area while watching clouds one of the kids says it would be cool if somebody cut the head off of the statue When Bart hears this he defends Jebediah and then the other three ridicule and tease him for it Bart walks away embarrassed When Bart walks home by himself he passes by the statue again and after thinking about what the kids said earlier he gets an idea Bart arrives home and talks to Homer in the kitchen about the importance of being popular Homer tells Bart that no matter what it takes popularity is the most important thing in life While the Simpsons are asleep Bart disguised in a ninja outfit heads to the town square and climbs to the top of the statue then decapitates Jebediah using a hack saw When he pushes the head down Bart guiltily asks himself what he has done Bart has the Head in his bedThe next morning Bart wakes up in bed next to the head of Jebediah an homage to “The Godfather” Bart heads downstairs to the kitchen with the head in his backpack where everyone is eating breakfast when a report comes over the radio announcing the decapitation of the town statue Bart starts to get nervous when he sees how everyone in the family becomes angry after hearing the report Scenes from Moes bar and the Springfield retirement home reveal that everyone else is upset about the statue as well In town Bart meets up with Jimbo Dolph and Kearney and is about to show them the head when he hears them say they were just kidding about decapitating the statue and would like to pound whoever stole Jebediahs head When Jimbo asks Bart whats in his backpack a voice in Barts head responds to him which turns out to be Barts guilty conscience Bart quickly picks up his backpack and hurries away toward home passing through a growing angry crowd downtown Back at home Bart quickly goes to the backyard and tries to bury the head but his guilty conscience acting as Jebediahs head talks him out of it As the rest of the family watches television Bart walks in with the head and confesses much to the shock of the family When Bart tells Homer he stole the head to become popular Homer realizes he is at fault as well as he misleadingly told Bart that fame was the most important thing in the world Homer and Bart head back into town with the headThe story ends where the episode began with Homer and Bart trying to return the head and being chased by the mob Bart is ready to face whatever punishment that citizens have in store for him but points out that it wasnt until the head was gone that everyone realized that they had taken the towns heritage for granted and also tells everyone that his guilt outweighs any punishment they might have in store for him Moved by his words the townspeople chose to allow Homer and Bart to return the head As he does Bart asks the head for forgiveness and he hears Jebidiahs voice granting

Marges birthday so Bart and Lisa prepare breakfast in bed for her During the surprise Homer thinks it is his birthday but quickly realizes he has forgotten Marges birthday He quickly hurries downstairs jumps in his car and drives to the mall At the mall Homer observes a bowling ball and gets an ideaJacques makes his debut in this episode in which he tries to seduce Marge and is somewhat successfulBack at the house Marge is on the phone with her sisters Patty and Selma who remind her about Homers lousy gift giving history and planning on where to go for her birthday dinner Cut back to the house where Homer hides Marges present and she informs him about dinner at The Singing Sirloin with the kids and her sisters Homer shudders at the thought of spending Marges birthday dinner with Patty and SelmaLater at the restaurant Marge is happy with Barts present of French perfume and Lisas dried macaroni and glue card of Marge as a Mona Lisa inspired art She is impressed with them working hard to make her feel loved on her birthday When it comes time for Homer to give his present Marge is offended when she sees a bowling ball fall on her cake complete with drilled holes and Homers name engraved on it Everyone including Bart Lisa and Maggie are shocked by his behavior However Patty and Selma sit by smugly due to their knowledge that Homer was being thoughtless to their sister as usual Marge is obviously outraged with Homer for ruining her birthday and reminds him that not only has she never gone bowling in her life but the ball is also inscribed with his name on it Ignoring her outrage he admires the beauty of the bowling ball and gives heavy hints that if she doesnt want it he will gladly take it off her handsBack at the house before going to bed Homer tries to defend his reasoning for getting Marge the bowling ball She doesnt buy it and believes that he only bought the ball so he can use it Marge decides to go ahead and use the bowling ball just to spite Homer Homer is upset because his plan for a new bowling ball has now backfired and realizes Marge is determined to learn how to bowl just to teach him a lessonThe next day at Barneys Bowlarama Marge goes bowling by herself and clearly does not know what she is doing A French accented man named Jacques bowling in the lane next to Marge comes over and offers bowling lessons to her and she accepts It is clear that Jacques is trying to seduce Marge and she is very flatteredBack at the house Homer does his fatherly duties and provides pizza for dinner and puts the kids to bed Later on with everyone asleep Marge finally comes home When Marge tells Homer she will be going bowling again the next night he becomes suspicious but doesnt say anything to her about it The next night at the bowling alley Jacques gives Marge a wrist guard for bowling with her name embroidered on it The seduction continues and Marge is clearly enjoying herself Later on Jacques drops off Marge at home and invites Marge to brunch the next day When she comes to bed late once again Homer is suspicious but doesnt say anythingThe next morning before school Marge gives Bart and Lisa large sack lunches with extra goodies inside and showers them with lots of love out of guilt and fear how traumatized they will be Lisa asks Marge if she is going bowling later and Marge answers yes says that Homer will take care of dinner and kisses her children goodbye Later on the bus while Bart comments on the cool lunches Lisa explains to him that Marge is feeling guilty because her marriage with Homer is starting to crumble Bart doesnt understand and denies the situation even exists At brunch with Jacques Marge is visibly nervous about being seen with another man and Helen Lovejoy the Reverends wife and local gossip stops by to chat Marge starts feeling even more uncomfortable and when Jacques asks her to meet with him at his apartment she faints During her fainting spell Marge dreams about the encounter with Jacques at his apartment In the dream Marge in a gown and Jacques in a tuxedo dance together and just as Jacques leans in to kiss her Marge wakes up from her dream Marge sees Jacques staring her in the eyes and she agrees to meet him again this time at his apartmentBack at home in the bedroom Homer discovers Marges wrist guard and fears the worst Bart comes in and asks Homer to play catch When playing catch in the backyard Homer is too depressed and lost in thought to pay attention Bart panics and realizes that Lisa is right about their parents marriage When he tries to seek her help Lisa doesnt help him as she revels in her own self pity and probably her own way of rubbing it in Barts face for not believing her earlier Bart offers Homer some advice and tells him to keep his mouth shut to Marge about the situation and maybe it wont get any worse The next morning while Marge is making the kids lunches for school Homer tells her how much he likes her sandwiches and mentions he doesnt believe in keeping feelings bottled up inside and then walks out to go to work Marge is touched by his words Cut to Jacques at his apartment getting ready for his meeting with Marge it is apparent that he plans on really putting the moves on Marge this time Back to Homer at work who is too preoccupied to eat his lunch as he believes it is the only thing he has left of MargeMeanwhile Marge is in the car headed for Jacques’ apartment and on the way there she is reminded about lifetime commitment when she sees various couples together clearly in love When she comes to a fork in the road with one way leading to Jacques and the other leading to Homer at the power plant she cant choose which way to go Cut back to Homer who is looking depressed at work when Marge walks in and taps him on the shoulder surprising him and making him forget all his worries As Homer carries Marge in his arms off to the backseat of her car he joyfully announces that I wont be back for ten minutes Jacquess fate remains unknown after this  \n",

candid photos around the house including ones of Homer and Marge during their respective private timesLater Homer announces that he is going to a bachelor party for Eugene Fisk his supervisor at the power plant formerly his assistant Marge chooses to take the kids to the Rusty Barnacle a seafood restaurant where Fisks bachelor party is taking place in a private room known as Davy Jones Locker Fisk and his father are uncomfortable and want to leave after a sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir arrives When Kashmir is unable to arouse the Fisks Homer is invited onstage to dance with her Homer has a great time dancing with Kashmir Bart later investigates the noisy party after stumbling upon it he left the table because he began to feel sick after witnessing his order of squid with extra tentacles and was heading back after using the buoys room observes Homer is onstage putting money in Kashmirs Gstring and snaps a photo with his spy cameraThe next day Bart joins the camera club at school In the dark red room as soon as the photo is developed President Martin Prince compliments Bart on the quality of the photo of Homer dancing with Princess Kashmir and asks to have a copy Bart refuses but gives one to Milhouse on the condition that he never lets it be copied and spread around Unfortunately many students who see the picture beg Milhouse for a copy and before long everyone in Springfield has one Marge sees a copy of the picture at her aerobics class and rips it from the wallLater Homer is on his way home from work oblivious to what others are referring to when

sends Bart to his room and after scolding Homer shoves a hastily halfpacked suitcase his way and drives him out of the houseHomer eventually spends the night at Barneys filthy apartment The next day—after enduring questioning from Mr Burns about the picture—Homer goes home to apologize but Marge doesnt want an apology she wants Homer to take Bart to meet Princess Kashmir and show that women are not sexual objectsLeft with no other alternative Homer and Bart scour the strip clubs of Springfield to find Princess Kashmir Eventually they track her down at the Sapphire Lounge Homer introduces himself and Bart to Kashmir who is preoccupied with getting onstage for her performance She eventually tells Homer about herself Just as Homer is about to leave he accidentally finds himself on stage for the nights feature attraction dancing with scantilyclad women from all nations Homer however after seeing Bart manages to make a passionate plea to the audience to treat women with respect His plea moves everybody in the audience and even the performing singer who decides to call his mother to check up on her Marge who is in the audience tearfully accepts Homers comments and the two make up

watching Krusty the Clown on TV Krusty launches into the TV screen in a motor car During the show a reluctant and unhappy Sideshow Bob is launched from a cannon as the wish of a girl as it was her birthday also an episode of Itchy and Scratchy is aired titled Burning Love Marge is hurt by the unnecessary violence in the show but Lisa points out if cartoons were meant for adults they would place it on prime time Marge calls and asks Homer to purchase some ice cream Homer is suspicious and shudders when he learns that Patty and Selma are coming over later to show slides of their Mexican vacation which turns out to be very boring Homer goes to the KwikEMart for ice cream on the way home and while there he witnesses a man that appears to be Krusty rob Apu at gunpoint Cut quickly to the Simpson house as the rest of the family watches Patty and Selmas slides Cut back to Homer who gives a description of Krusty to the police Meanwhile at Krustys apartment Krusty is relaxing with a drink when a SWAT team bursts through his door and takes him into custodyVideo footage of Homer stepping on Krustys footAt the police station Homer identifies Krusty as the armed robber Homer finally gets home just as Patty and Selma finish the slideshow being grateful for once having missed the boring viewing Then the news report about Krustys arrest comes on the air with Emmy awardwinning Kent Brockmans standin Scott Christian Homer must deal with Marges embarrassment along with Patty and Selmas rage when he learns they heard what he mentioned on the security tape In a bluetinted scene Bart is devastated that his idol Krusty could have done such a thingOn the news Kent Brockman reports on the upcoming trial and history of Krusty the Clown including the fact that Krusty has a pacemaker Reverend Lovejoy calls for a public burning of all Krusty merchandise The next day as Krusty walks up the steps to the courthouse Bart and Lisa watch in disbelief The man they see is far different from the clown in the gaudy outfit on TV this Krusty is without makeup and wearing a prison uniform with small feet as he is without his signature oversized shoes Inside the courtroom during the trial Homer being called as a witness points out Krusty to the jury as the robber Later back at the house Homer and Marge gather up all the Krusty merchandise in the house and head to the public burningAn upset Bart watches as the pile of merchandise goes up in flames The next day at the trial it is revealed after being asked to identify some evidence that Krusty is illiterate The evidence that Krusty is asked to identify are betting slips which suggests Krusty committed the robbery as this evidence combined with an audit of Krustys finances shows he lost considerable amounts of money illegally wagering on sporting events which Krusty admits to Later the jury reaches a guilty verdict At the Simpson house Lisa and Maggie watch Sideshow Bob who has now taken over for Krusty on TV He promises that while the show will be more educational it will retain the popular The Itchy  Scratchy Show When Bart walks in and sees this he is upset He tells Lisa he thinks Krusty is innocent and convinces her to help him prove itSad Bart with Krusty doll BluetintedBart and Lisa go to the KwikEMart to examine the crime through the security camera footage after convincing a reluctant Apu to let them look around Lisa quickly notices discrepancies in the prosecutions case She recalls that the robber had used the microwave oven at the checkout counter to heat a burrito which has a sign warning that it is unsafe for pacemaker users Lisa mentions that a few years ago Krusty suffered a heart attack during a live broadcast of his show and had a pacemaker installed She also recalls the robber was reading The Springfield Review of Books magazine yet Krusty revealed his illiteracy during the trial Upon learning these two clues she realizes that Bart was right and accepts the fact Krusty was framed for a crime he didnt commit Lisa asks him if Krusty has enemies who wanted to see him framed Bart suggests they go and visit his best friend Sideshow Bob because he may be able to identify any known enemies who hated Krusty enough to see him go to prison Meanwhile Sideshow Bob is finishing up a show and tells the crew he wishes to be alone for a while as he is still depressed over Krustys conviction As he goes into his dressing room his crying transforms into sinister laughterBart announces Krustys innocenceAt the television studio Bob has a meeting with the show runners and discuss merchandise ideas Bart Lisa and Maggie pay a visit to Sideshow Bob He dismisses them because his show is about to start but he offers them free tickets In the audience a visibly saddened Bart watches the show When Sideshow Bob notices Barts sadness he invites him on stage for a new psychological segment of the show called Choices While on stage Bart reveals he is sad because he thinks that Krusty was framed and wrongfully jailed but Bob tries to convince him otherwise brushing off the clues he and Lisa found by claiming that Krusty was never one to follow doctors orders seriously and pointing out that The Springfield Review of Books contains amusing caricatures that anyone can enjoy Bob does get sore when Bart reminds him of the time he used to be Krustys sidekick which he remarks darkly that the clown shot him out of a cannon When Bob mentions that he has big shoes to fill Bart connects the final piece of the mystery together recalling that Homer stepped on the robbers toes and made him scream in pain However when he and Lisa saw Krusty going into the courtroom they noticed that he had normal sized feet Bart believes if he had actually been there at the KwikEMart and Homer step on his shoes he would never felt it Remembering that Bob has feet large enough to fill Krustys clown shoes from their attempt to speak to him Bart concludes that Bob is the real robber and he was the one who yelled at Homer for stepping on his feetOutraged by the truth Bart rightfully levels his accusation towards Sideshow Bob He grabs the microphone and contends to the audience about his new discovery Bart then proves his point by smashing the end of Bobs clown shoe with a mallet This causes Bob to scream in pain and say the exact words spoken by the robber much to the kids shock Bart pounds Bobs other foot causing him to fall down and removes his shoes to expose his big feet on TV as the audience turn on Bob for what he did to Krusty While watching the show and eating donuts the police realize Bart is right and they overlooked one key piece of evidence that could have kept Krusty out of jail Chief Wiggum who is also eating a donut orders the officers to go to the studio and arrest Sideshow Bob for the robberyBarts room with new Krusty the Clown merchandiseOutside the studio an arrested and exposed Bob dramatically confesses to the crime He reveals that he framed Krusty for the KwikEMart robbery out of frustration because he finally got sick of constantly being on the receiving end of Krustys humiliating antics for more ratings as well as the fact that Krusty squandered much of the shows profits on gambling and other examples of his vulgar appetites Bob felt his intelligence was wasted on the show and wanted Krusty gone so he could make an educational program where his intelligence would be appreciated by the public Before being carted off to jail Bob pays a grudging kudos to the Simpson children with the often used line from ScoobyDoo I would have gotten away with it too if it hadnt been for those meddling kids and swears revenge on Bart for foiling his plan He dramatically warns criminals to start treating children as equals because they were smart enough to catch him and will do the same to them The charges against Krusty are dropped and he now regains the trust of the community Chief Wiggum and the citizens apologize to Krusty for their misunderstanding and Homer offers an apology for fingering him in court Grateful to be free Krusty forgives the populace for their wrong accusations and thanks Bart for standing up for the truth and sticking to his convictions The episode finishes with Bart proudly tacking up a photo of himself and Krusty on the wall before going to bed with his room refurnished with new Krusty the Clown merchandiseSideshow Bob as the fake KrustySideshow Bob makes his first appearance as a major character in this episode However his official first appearance was in the background of a scene in the season one episode The Telltale Head Bobs design was revamped with his original Afro being turned into his nowfamous palm tree style James Earl Jones was originally cast as Bob but the producers chose to try Kelsey Grammer Also making their first appearances in this episode are Kent Brockman and Scott Christian This is the only episode of Season 1 where the main character of the episode isnt one of the Simpsons family membersThe episode finished thirteenth place for May 23–29 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 164 The episode received positive reviews from critics Matt Groening has listed it as his ninth favorite episode of the show and said I have a peculiar love of TV clownery In a DVD review of the first season David B Grelck gave the episode a rating of 35 Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that throughout the episode we found great material it really seemed clear that the show was starting to turn into the piece we now know and love It’s hard for me to relate any

Friday morning the Simpson family are eating breakfast together Lisa and Bart have a tugofwar over a donut causing the box to rip open and Homer who eats the donut much to Bart and Lisas disapproval is reading the newspaper After Bart and Lisa leave for school Homer leaves for work at the power plant without noticing and saying goodbye to Marge Marge and Maggie are then left alone at home while listening to Bill Pye on the radio Not long later a commercial comes on the radio which wants Marge to call Dr Marvin Monroes ontheair therapy if she has problems with life She does so and tells Monroe that she is tired of HomerAt work Homer hears Marge talking about him on the phone which other power plant employees also hear and they laugh at it Homer who is embarrassed about hearing Marge over the radio later goes to Moes Tavern instead of home that night where he asks Moe for advice Moe tells Homer that he should take her to a fancy restaurant spend one night at a hotel and buy her some flowers Back at home as a furious Marge impatiently waits for him to come home and tell him off Bart Lisa and Maggie wisely keep their distance from her At the florists Howards Flowers Homer buys a single rose as the flowers are very expensive Homer arrives home with the wilted rose and a box of chocolates and tells Marge that he loves her Marges complexion softens and tells Homer that she loves him and apologizes for taking him for granted Homer forgives Marge and chooses to take her out to where Moe suggestedMeanwhile Bart has made various prank calls to Moes Tavern However his folks are faced with a problem when they realize that their kids have no one to watch over them To find a babysitter Marge picks up the phone and is surprised that Moe is still yapping at Bart for the Oliver Clozoff prank and hangs up assuming that it was a crossed wire She picks it up again and calls the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers Babysitting Service However the receptionist immediately freaks out telling her that she must be kidding when Marge identifies herself as Mrs Simpson She quickly refuses their services to the Simpson children due to their bad reputation with the babysitting service for a long time which resulted in the Simpsons being blacklisted from being babysat by them Not giving up in the slightest Homer then calls under the alias Homer Samson and hires a rather rude babysitter named Miss BotzWhen Miss Botz arrives with two suspicious looking suitcases nonetheless Marge whos already pampered up for her night with Homer whos also pampered up tells her that Maggie has to go to sleep immediately but Bart and Lisa can stay up for an hour longer and watch The Happy Little Elves Meet the Curious Bear Cub much to Barts horror and hatred of the elves When Bart tries to suggest alternate viewing in order to avoid watching the elves Miss Botz quickly puts him in his place by mentioning that she dealt with troublesome children like him before and makes him watch the video with Lisa while she puts Maggie to bed After a while Bart starts to get sick of the elves so he plans to switch to Americas Most Armed and Dangerous where the host is talking to the audience about the notorious Babysitter Bandit whose real name is Lucille Botzcowski The host also warns the viewers that she might be using a clever alias He then shows a mugshot of the criminal on TV who looks just like Miss BotzLater as if on cue Miss Botz who really is the Babysitter Bandit comes into the room which scares Bart and Lisa as they scream and run out of the room to hide Bart hides in the basement while Lisa goes into the kitchen and tries to call 1800USQUEAL on the phone When Miss Botz tries to look for Bart in the basement he tries to knock her out with Marges bowling ball but to no avail as Bart drops onto the floor and Miss Botz notices him thus getting caught by her In the kitchen Lisa reports over the phone about Miss Botz but Miss Botz is behind her pulling her in with a rope Lisa notices this but just as when she is in the middle of reporting about the bandit Miss Botz captures LisaBack in the living room Miss Botz puts Bart and Lisa on the couch and ties them up Bart keeps on talking and moaning that she wont get away with it making Miss Botz tape Barts mouth up thus being gagged and cant talk Miss Botz then turns on the Happy Little Elves video again for them which bothers Bart a lot more as he makes noises from underneath the tape Eventually a smug Lisa tells him to shut up and make the best of the situation Meanwhile Homer and Marge are enjoying a fancy dinner at Chez Paree having lobsters Once done with their meal they go to the Ye Olde OffRamp Inn where Marge has some time together with Homer in their hotel roomBack at the house Maggie wakes up and goes downstairs to find her siblings tied up just as The Happy Little Elves video ends Bart has finally had it with the elves so he pounds his head on the couch in anger Lisa tells Maggie that she will be able to watch the video again if she unties her Maggie complies saving the day once moreThe kids then decide to plan a strategy to kidnap Miss Botz Maggie goes up the stairs and is nearby her parents room where Lucille Botzcowski is robbing their closet Botzcowski tired of the incompetent and bothersome Simpson children follows Maggies pacifier sucking sounds and into Barts room with the lights off where she is hit on the head by Bart wielding a baseball bat It turns out that Bart was also using Maggies pacifier to accomplish the deed Meanwhile Marge discovers that there is no answer at home due to Miss Botz disabling all of the phones in the home Back at home with no way to call about the bandit from their home Bart Lisa and Maggie rush outside to a local pay phone and alert the authorities but not before tying Lucille Botzcowski up and gagging her and then forcing her to watch The Happy Little Elves videoMarge and Homer arrive home still worried about not getting an answer Eventually they find Lucille Botzcowski bound and gagged and after they ungag her she begs them to turn off the tape and warns Homer not to take his eyes off of Bart for a second They then send her home with all of her suitcases in which the stolen items are contained which Homer and Marge didnt notice plus three times her regular pay The police then arrive along with the media but as Bart tries to lead them to the living room Homer grabs Bart by the shirt and berates him for his behavior towards Miss Botz However Homers cut off by a reporter who asks him if hes saying that he unwittingly aided the escape of the Babysitter Bandit Realizing his mistake a humiliated Homer tries to save face by claiming that he fought Miss Botz before she escaped much to the childrens dismayLater Homer and Marge are in bed where Homer is watching himself looking foolish on television so he turns it off while lamenting about being branded a boob by the entire community remarking that he just isnt that bright Marge says that she loves him the way he is and that if he has three children who managed to capture a criminal by themselves he must be doing something right She then kisses Homer as she turns the lamp off for bedtimeA work print of the episode was the first to come back from Korea as episodes of The Simpsons are often animated overseas to a South Korean animation studio AKOM due to the overload of episodes and saving costs in Korea The Simpsons Shorts where everything was produced inhouse in KlaskyCsupo although the domestic studio produces only the character and background layout of episodes The original rough version of Some Enchanted Evening is incomplete as it ends when Bart and Lisa just find out Miss Botz is Americas Most Wanted and sound effects and a soundtrack are absent and would have been inserted had there been a final version The work print was not well received in the Gracie Films bungalow with James L Brooks giving a response with profanity Some Enchanted Evening was the first one produced explaining why its 7G01The Simpsons Pilot EpisodeSome scenes of the original version of the episodeThe producers wanted a realistic environment for The Simpsons as other studios had unrealistic styles for animation such as Disney Warner Bros HannaBarbera etc The former two had a universe where the universe was bendy and characters seemed to be made out of rubber HannaBarbera used cartoon sounds which were also declined While the shorts lacked much realism in animation the halfhour series had been intended to be as realistic as possible despite the unrealistic animation 70 of the episodes had to be redone The episode was worked on during the course of the first season until finally being aired on May 13 1990 as the season finale The producers considered aborting production of the series if the next episode Bart the Genius has similar production difficulties although fortunately had several fixable animation problems They convinced FOX to postpone the season premiere for several months Although Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire the eighth episode in production order had to be aired as it was a Christmas special in December of 1989 becoming the first episode of the first season and the first episode of The Simpsons overallAlso at the end of this episode originally Marge would reveal that under her blue hair contained a pair of rabbit ears This is a clear reference to Matt Groenings comic ¨Life in Hell¨ But this ending was scraped for unknown reasons This theory made it into ¨The Simpsons Arcade Game¨ When Marge gets electrified in the game you can see rabbit ears in her hairAlthough the episode was the first produced of Season 1 and the series with its production code being 7G01 as opposed to later codes such as 7G08 from the first episode Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire production was delayed and overhauled after a workprint1 had been poorly received and covered 70 of the episode This share of the episode had to be remade and rewritten while airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire for it being a Christmas special having to air it in Christmas 1989 and becoming the first episode during this hiatus the first episode in broadcasting order and the first episode of the series instead  "

       "      <td>Homer hastily drives the Family Sedan with Marge and Maggie through a snowcovered street They are late for Bart and Lisas Christmas pageant at Springfield Elementary School After crashing into a pile of snow at the front of Springfield Elementary School park Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduce the second grade The children do a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world such as Ralph Wiggum as Hotei Oshō Dewey Largo introduces Lisa playing Tawanga the Santa Claus of the South Seas Lisa’s dance causes awe throughout the crowd Lisa performs a skilled dance with lit torches performing tricks such as throwing it around herself – Lisa also wears seethrough clothing effectively ‘revealing Lisa completely at the end of her act Skinner eventually introduces the fourth grade singing Christmas carols Jingle Bells is sung first and after the first verse Bart picks up his voice volume during the chorus and sings a Batmanthemed parody causing an irate Skinner to withdraw Bart from the performance Homer gives a disappointed look for Barts actions but as the pageant continues he grows bored and wonders aloud how long the pageant will lastAt the Simpson family home Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards as Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names and stories Marge soon stops writing due to Homers grumpy demeanor Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists Marge is uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover future costs Bart then undergoes a “James Bond”style operation Back at home Lisa tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out Marge tells him to calm down and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus further for the year Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk choosing to conceal the truth Once outside he looks at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair on the sidewalkMarge senses something is amiss with Homer and asks if there is something wrong Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping so she doesnt have to Marge agrees and is content with Homers answer the two sleep The next day Homer does the Christmas shopping alone at Circus of Values He purchases pantyhose for Marge pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie While purchasing such dismal presents Homer uses empty optimism to assure his own self On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned and Todd while he carries an armful of fancily wrapped packages All the presents are spilled onto the ground and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought Ned attempts to sort the presents unintentionally gloating his wealth At Moes Tavern Homer drinks a beer alone when a cheerful Barney arrives wearing a Santa Claus costume Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a parttime job acting as a department store Santa at the mall Homer suddenly has an idea so he goes to the personnel office in the mall where he fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa After he finishes reviewing Homers application as well as interviewing him the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues with the Hypnotist as the teacherHomer finally gets home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been Homer assures the insignificance of his tardiness and heads upstairs but Marge tells him they have guests Patty and Selma As Homer talks to Patty and Selma they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet Homer gives false information and tells them he was about to leave and he rushes out the door In the car Homer drives past several Christmas tree lots gradually the trees become cheaper from the earlier expensive ones Eventually he stops at a private Christmas Tree Farm and uses a chainsaw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family Homer is soon met with retaliation the farm owner fires his gun upon Homer and has two hounds pursue However Homer escapes relatively easily Back at home Homer stands up the tree and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma On Christmas Eve at the mall Homer works as Santa Claus while children wait in line to sit on his lap one being a very greedy child From a distance Bart Milhouse and Lewis watch the children line up to sit on Santas lap while they comment on the gullibility of the kids Milhouse dares Bart to yank off Santas beard and Bart agrees Bart jumps in line and finally gets his turn on Santas lap Not knowing that Santa is really Homer Bart yanks off his beard Bart is surprised at what he uncovers and Homer escorts Bart into Santas workshop for speaking in private leaving Alfie to cover for him Homer explains the situation to Bart who understands and feels terrible for pulling Homers beard offBart goes with Homer as he picks up his check Homer is surprised to learn that his net pay is only 13 despite his 120 gross pay When he questions the cashier she explains the majority of his check went to pay for the Santa suit and beard social security unemployment

Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the episode finished thirtieth in the week of December 11–17 1989 It concluded with a Nielsen rating of 145 and was viewed in approximately 134 million homes</td>\n",

into a pile of snow at the front of Springfield Elementary School park Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduce the second grade The children do a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world such as Ralph Wiggum as Hotei Oshō Dewey Largo introduces Lisa playing Tawanga the Santa Claus of the South Seas Lisa’s dance causes awe throughout the crowd Lisa performs a skilled dance with lit torches performing tricks such as throwing it around herself – Lisa also wears seethrough clothing effectively ‘revealing Lisa completely at the end of her act Skinner eventually introduces the fourth grade singing Christmas carols Jingle Bells is sung first and after the first verse Bart picks up his voice volume during the chorus and sings a Batmanthemed parody causing an irate Skinner to withdraw Bart from the performance Homer gives a disappointed look for Barts actions but as the pageant continues he grows bored and wonders aloud how long the pageant will lastAt the Simpson family home Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards as Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names and stories Marge soon stops writing due to Homers grumpy demeanor Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists Marge is uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover future costs Bart then undergoes a “James Bond”style operation Back at home Lisa tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out Marge tells him to calm down and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus further for the year Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk choosing to conceal the truth Once outside he looks at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair on the sidewalkMarge senses something is amiss with Homer and asks if there is something wrong Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping so she doesnt have to Marge agrees and is content with Homers answer the two sleep The next day Homer does the Christmas shopping alone at Circus of Values He purchases pantyhose for Marge pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie While purchasing such dismal presents Homer uses empty optimism to assure his own self On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned and Todd while he carries an armful of fancily wrapped packages All the presents are spilled onto the ground and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought Ned attempts to sort the presents unintentionally gloating his wealth At Moes Tavern Homer drinks a beer alone when a cheerful Barney arrives wearing a Santa Claus costume Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a parttime job acting as a department store Santa at the mall Homer suddenly has an idea so he goes to the personnel office in the mall where he fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa After he finishes reviewing Homers application as well as interviewing him the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues with the Hypnotist as the teacherHomer finally gets home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been Homer assures the insignificance of his tardiness and heads upstairs but Marge tells him they have guests Patty and Selma As Homer talks to Patty and Selma they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet Homer gives false information and tells them he was about to leave and he rushes out the door In the car Homer drives past several Christmas tree lots gradually the trees become cheaper from the earlier expensive ones Eventually he stops at a private Christmas Tree Farm and uses a chainsaw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family Homer is soon met with retaliation the farm owner fires his gun upon Homer and has two hounds pursue However Homer escapes relatively easily Back at home Homer stands up the tree and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma On Christmas Eve at the mall Homer works as Santa Claus while children wait in line to sit on his lap one being a very greedy child From a distance Bart Milhouse and Lewis watch the children line up to sit on Santas lap while

Homer Bart yanks off his beard Bart is surprised at what he uncovers and Homer escorts Bart into Santas workshop for speaking in private leaving Alfie to cover for him Homer explains the situation to Bart who understands and feels terrible for pulling Homers beard offBart goes with Homer as he picks up his check Homer is surprised to learn that his net pay is only 13 despite his 120 gross pay When

depressed Homer sits down to figure out what to do with the 13 an excited Barney tells Homer that he is going to the Springfield Downs to place a bet with his earnings He invites Homer to come along with him ensuring a win on the dog Whirlwind Homer is reluctant but Bart convinces him to go citing that this might be their only chance to save the Simpson family ChristmasPatty Selma Abe Simpson Marge Maggie and Lisa wait for Homer and Bart to come home while watching a The Happy Little Elves Christmas special Meanwhile at the dog track Barney insists Homer should bet on Whirlwind After seeing what Whirlwind looks like Homer is reluctant to bet on him Just then an announcement plays over the PA system a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing Sir Galahad in the fourth race Bart senses that the announcement is an omen and chooses to ask Homer to bet on him and despite the fact that the odds are ninetynine to one which means that the dogs winning chances are extremely rare Homer puts down all 13 on Santas Little Helper Meanwhile at home Patty and Selma talk bad about Homer while everyone waits for him and Bart Lisa then explains to Patty how her bad mouthing will damage herself confusing Patty Back at the track Homer and Bart anxiously await the running of the fourth race As the race begins Homer and Bart cheer on Santas Little Helper but Whirlwind Barneys

However in the end Bart interrupts once again causing Homer to strangle Bart while shouting Why you littleSimpsons Roasting on an Open FireTranscriptThe Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the

empty— Katara Avatar The Last Airbender to her mothers murdererSomeone delivers a speech to another character on all the reasons why that other character sucks or is a horrible person There are several contexts in which this can happen    openclose all folders      A Villain Addresses a Hero Not only has the Big Bad killed your Love Interest slain the Team Pet and finally taken over the world they must grind your selfworth into the asphalt and explain to you why you failed to stop their Evil Plan This is where they list all the reasons you are a poor excuse for a heroine and never had a prayer of stopping them you lack the skills the weapons and the powers needed you childishly fight for outdated ideals your costume is ugly and your mentor always hated youFrequently a brand of Evil Gloating andor Break Them by Talking In a welldone speech the villain will state things that the hero and audience cant argue with and when the fight is done the hero stays troubled because the Villain Has a Point However maybe theyre total BS but its delivered with such conviction it almost makes the hero and audience agree that they were wrong to have dared challenge the villain in the first placeSometimes it makes the point that the people the hero are trying to defend arent worth the trouble An especially arrogant Big Bad will use this to let the hero know theyre just a lesser version of the Big Bad himself and the only difference is theyre not saddled with morals A villain going for a lowblow might bring up some previous encounter between the two when they overpowered the hero as to state that the same thing will happen again What You Are in the Dark can and often does followMaybe the hero hurt the villain in the past or even caused their Start of Darkness maybe they abandoned them believed they were dead made them feel like theyd been replaced etc This will be what the villain addresses in this speech reminding the hero of everything theyve done to hurt them The hero might even be affected by this and have no good responseA hero worth their salt might respond with their own speech along the lines of a No More Holding Back Speech or a Picard or Kirk Summation among others If its an action movie the hero will usually say Shut Up Hannibal and then declare what and who they truly are Sometimes the hero survives only because theyre Not Worth Killing in which case theyll invariably prove that they are later in the story Often a Moment of Awesome if a Jerkass gives this to someone and they respond with a better one    A Hero Addresses a Villain Heroes can also give defeated villains The Reason You Suck Speeches often pointing out their wasted potential their callous nature and a lack of any altruistic quality or how their obsession with defeating the hero has ruined them or in the case of the WellIntentioned Extremist adversary how theyve become everything theyve fought against or how their extremes in trying to bring a better world have done more to ruin it Heroic The Reason You Suck Speeches come out when the heros not going to bother with the Kirk Summation Chances are they tried the diplomatic option and it didnt sink inA villain will usually respond by entering a Villainous Breakdown upon realizing the heros words have a grain of truth to them and being unable to stand it The WellIntentioned Extremist may acknowledge it but then state Ive Come Too Far Sometimes the villain will say Shut Up Kirk and mock them for thinking they could be swayed by mere words    A Villain Addresses Another Villain Villains can also give this to other villains on an Evil Versus Evil stage The content of this speech is usually along the lines of how theyre Eviler than Thou and pointing out flaws and shortcomings in the other villain like the Magnificent Bastard or Bitch chiding a Smug Snake a CardCarrying Villain mocking a Knight Templar for employing the same methods but believing their actions to be right and just a calculating practitioner of Pragmatic Villainy berating a Stupid Evil villain for being too sadistic to actually achieve anything or in a conflict between the Evil Genius and The Brute have the Evil Genius mock the Brute for using brute force to compensate for their low intelligence and explain their simplemindedness makes him predictable and as such easy to beat or the Brute pointing out how the Evil Genius relies on their minions and Humongous Mecha to fight their battles and for all their vaunted intelligence they cant make any of their big schemes stickAlternatively it could take the form of Even Evil Has Standards if the other villain did something they find completely unnecessary and appalling If two or more Professional Killers are hired to track down the heroes a Psycho for Hire can get this from a Hitman with a Heart who voices their disgust at the formers capacity for torture rape and enjoyment of destruction and killing or a Consummate Professional who loses patience with how their psychotic tendencies draw unwanted attention and their distaste for taking the simple approach makes the mission needlessly complicated If the Big Bad crosses the Moral Event Horizon the Noble Top Enforcer may drop one explaining how they were let down by their boss and feel betrayed by the one they looked up to before they quit A Defector from Decadence may give one against their entire country before they leave and if two villains team up to fight the heroes one of them may eventually break off their partnership with one of these as a way of establishing them as the Lighter Shade of Black Either way it can be a Moment of Awesome when the person on the receiving end has it comingThis form often doubles as a way to explain the reasoning behind a Villainous Rescue without Leaning on the Fourth Wall too hard    A Hero Addresses Another Hero Speeches from hero to hero usually come up whenever a heros Designated Hero status becomes irritating to the other protagonist or they feel that the hero being called out must be taken down a peg or more This is also occasionally done in Good Versus Good scenarios where a protagonists morality is being called into question by another protagonist who doesnt agree with their methods It usually takes place following a hero doing something particularly unheroic or if their general unpleasantness has gone past the point of acceptance Often doubles as What Were You Thinking and What the Hell Hero and in particularly bad circumstances it may cause allies to turn against one another    An AcquaintanceFriend Addresses Another AcquaintanceFriend This speech is given by someone whos just frustrated with the other person This is not an attempt to bring down or break an opponent This is not an exchange between heroes and villains heck they might even be friends This is someone tired of everything they have to deal with giving a frank and brutally honest assessment of the person theyre dealing with often in a What the Hell Hero moment This can be prone to backfire with a suitably shallow selfobsessed andor savvy target who typically responds with Youve just listed all of my best features Other times however the one who gave the speech overreacted and says that they are too harsh and its not really how they feel Will often provoke an attempted refutation or justification from the target which depending on the source can be played for comedy drama or Wangst If the target is a Designated Hero this occurrence just might motivate them to become a real hero    A Protagonist Calls Out Themselves Sometimes a protagonist in a particular shows is so filled with selfloathing that when prompted decide that theyre fed up with themselves and calls out the worst of villains themselves If done in a comedy or a Dramedy this is usually Played for Laughs However in other cases this is almost always done for drama This might be because the hero is suffering Heroic BSoD or might have implied or explicitly stated to suffer Depression This is the ultimate form of SelfDeprecation in a work Of course this could also be done to get people to sympathize with the protagonist    Someone Calls Out the Crowd The indulgences of the crowd disgusts the speaker to such an extent that they must speak out against it Calling everyone in attendance for their failures in life in a cruel but often necessary manner If it gets meta and is directed at the audience it also counts as You BastardOne thing all seven types of speech have in common is that the speaker has a point even if theyre villains To give a speech about it the speaker has to have thought it through and can usually have more than one reason why you suck This is because the writer of the story has also thought it through This is a sister trope to Calling the Old Man Out or Calling the Old Woman Out Compare Talking the Monster to Death where this is meant to kill or redeem a villain Could also be a Take That Scrappy where someone tells a hated character what the audience feels about them This can lead to failure if the character receiving the speech Cant Take Criticism Can also overlap with a Cowardice Callout which is when someone calls someone else out for fearbased shortcomingsCompare and contrast the No More Holding Back Speech which may incorporate elements of this See also Did You Actually Believe and Youre Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum An ArmorPiercing Response can provide a short but effective way of calling someone out Put to music this is The Diss Track and can become a The Villain Sucks Song or The Hero Sucks Song ForeignLanguage Tirade is quite fittingly a foreignlanguage variant of this tropeContrast Minor Insult Meltdown where just the tip of the you suck iceberg can sink someone to tears Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark See also Compassionate Critic and Constructive CriticismLastly no this isnt the trope thats about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You Finally youll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches too</td>\n",

               Just another Tuesday for Princess Peach Its time I gave you a proper thankyou Pucker up handsome— Flurrie Paper Mario The ThousandYear DoorMy hero mwahSome men quest for glory fame and riches Some men seek power and strength Some want To Be a MasterAnd some guys just want a kiss from the princess theyre trying to saveFor some strange reason princesses and other Love Interests seem to love giving out kisses as rewards for helping them The smooch of victory is a standard part of the Rescue Romance but it can appear in almost any scenario where a guy has the potential to impress a girl—either by winning a contest saving her from a horrible beast recovering her purse from thugs or whatever the plot writers think up The scenario generally goes like this Alice is in trouble Bob vows to help her Alternatively Bob is entering a contest He vows to win for Alices sake Bob overcomes obstacles goes through many trials and goes through hell and back for Alice He eventually saves Alice or reaches his goal Alice says to Bob Oh Bob How can I ever thank you Alice then proceeds to show Bob exactly how she can thank him by giving him lipstick imprints right on the face If this is Bobs first Big Damn Heroes moment it will often result in PostKiss CatatoniaMay also occur in an AfterAction PatchUp in which case she may merely acknowledge his courage first — or may berate him for stupidly getting into the matter firstUsually Bob is a Nice Guy and hes perfectly content with receiving a kiss as his reward If hes lucky he might even get a fullon makeout session with the girl he just helped If hes not well even a chaste kiss on the cheek is pretty sweet Sometimes though Bob might be a lech whos only trying to help the girl in the hopes of lockin lips with her Thus this is one of those frequently invoked tropesThe most common ways to play with this trope are to have the kissee not want the kiss for some reason and try his darndest not to get it Alternatively if he goes into the rescue or competition expecting a kiss the girl at the other end may well refuse to give him one The question of why its desired if its out of obligation and thus doesnt actually mean anything may not be addressed A growing number of examples exists where both parties are the same sex if only for the sake of a quick jokeNote that in many historical settings kissing an eligible member of the opposite sex is Serious Business it may go all the way up to being tantamount to a marriage proposalSometimes it might be unplanned or the victory coincides with the resolving of their UST When prefaced with aggression its SlapSlapKissOne of the most popular methods of Ship Teasing Can overlap with The Big Damn Kiss if Rescue Romance is involvedIf the smooch is given by a damsel after being

It This Way—is the polar opposite of Appeal to Novelty where the older position is right See also They Changed It Now It Sucks Nostalgia Filter Older Is Better Ludd Was Right Good Old Ways and New Media Are Evil This tends to be rolled out regarding consumer products and morality in the former case they dont make em like they used to and in the latter it was better in the good ol days Old ways do tend to be workable or they dont become old ways in the first place what makes this a fallacy is the unstated assumption that no better way is possible See also Culture Justifies Anything and Nobody Ever Complained Before Quite similar to Appeal to Nature Cases of They Changed It Now It Sucks often fall into this fallacy eg Character x has always had blue eyes before so changing her eyes to green is bad  \n",
       "3  I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing But now that I see you I think I understand Theres just nothing inside you Nothing at all Youre pathetic and sad and empty— Katara Avatar The Last Airbender to her mothers murdererSomeone delivers a speech to another character on all the reasons why that other character sucks or is a horrible person There are several contexts in which this can happen    openclose all folders      A Villain Addresses a Hero Not only has the Big Bad killed your Love Interest slain the Team Pet and finally taken over the world they must grind your selfworth into the asphalt and explain to you why you failed to stop their Evil Plan This is where they list all the reasons you are a poor excuse for a heroine and never had a prayer of stopping them you lack the skills the weapons and the powers needed you childishly fight for outdated ideals your costume is ugly and your mentor always hated youFrequently a brand of Evil Gloating andor Break Them by Talking In a welldone speech the villain will state things that the hero and audience cant argue with and when the fight is done the hero stays troubled because the Villain Has a Point However maybe theyre total BS but its delivered with such conviction it almost makes the hero and audience agree that they were wrong to have dared challenge the villain in the first placeSometimes it makes the point that the people the hero are trying to defend arent worth the trouble An especially arrogant Big Bad will use this to let the hero know theyre just a lesser version of the Big Bad himself and the only difference is theyre not saddled with morals A villain going for a lowblow might bring up some previous encounter between the two when they overpowered the hero as to state that the same thing will happen again What You Are in the Dark can and often does followMaybe the hero hurt the villain in the past or even caused their Start of Darkness maybe they abandoned them believed they were dead made them feel like theyd been replaced etc This will be what the villain addresses in this speech reminding the hero of everything theyve done to hurt them The hero might even be affected by this and have no good responseA hero worth their salt might respond with their own speech along the lines of a No More Holding Back Speech or a Picard or Kirk Summation among others If its an action movie the hero will usually say Shut Up Hannibal and then declare what and who they truly are Sometimes the hero survives only because theyre Not Worth Killing in which case theyll invariably prove that they are later in the story Often a Moment of Awesome if a Jerkass gives this to someone and they respond with a better one    A Hero Addresses a Villain Heroes can also give defeated villains The Reason You Suck Speeches often pointing out their wasted potential their callous nature and a lack of any altruistic quality or how their obsession with defeating the hero has ruined them or in the case of the WellIntentioned Extremist adversary how theyve become everything theyve fought against or how their extremes in trying to bring a better world have done more to ruin it Heroic The Reason You Suck Speeches come out when the heros not going to bother with the Kirk Summation Chances are they tried the diplomatic option and it didnt sink inA villain will usually respond by entering a Villainous Breakdown upon realizing the heros words have a grain of truth to them and being unable to stand it The WellIntentioned Extremist may acknowledge it but then state Ive Come Too Far Sometimes the villain will say Shut Up Kirk and mock them for thinking they could be swayed by mere words    A Villain Addresses Another Villain Villains can also give this to other villains on an Evil Versus Evil stage The content of this speech is usually along the lines of how theyre Eviler than Thou and pointing out flaws and shortcomings in the other villain like the Magnificent Bastard or Bitch chiding a Smug Snake a CardCarrying Villain mocking a Knight Templar for employing the same methods but believing their actions to be right and just a calculating practitioner of Pragmatic Villainy berating a Stupid Evil villain for being too sadistic to actually achieve anything or in a conflict between the Evil Genius and The Brute have the Evil Genius mock the Brute for using brute force to compensate for their low intelligence and explain their simplemindedness makes him predictable and as such easy to beat or the Brute pointing out how the Evil Genius relies on their minions and Humongous Mecha to fight their battles and for all their vaunted intelligence they cant make any of their big schemes stickAlternatively it could take the form of Even Evil Has Standards if the other villain did something they find completely unnecessary and appalling If two or more Professional Killers are hired to track down the heroes a Psycho for Hire can get this from a Hitman with a Heart who voices their disgust at the formers capacity for torture rape and enjoyment of destruction and killing or a Consummate Professional who loses patience with how their psychotic tendencies draw unwanted attention and their distaste for taking the simple approach makes the mission needlessly complicated If the Big Bad crosses the Moral Event Horizon the Noble Top Enforcer may drop one explaining how they were let down by their boss and feel betrayed by the one they looked up to before they quit A Defector from Decadence may give one against their entire country before they leave and if two villains team up to fight the heroes one of them may eventually break off their partnership with one of these as a way of establishing them as the Lighter Shade of Black Either way it can be a Moment of Awesome when the person on the receiving end has it comingThis form often doubles as a way to explain the reasoning behind a Villainous Rescue without Leaning on the Fourth Wall too hard    A Hero Addresses Another Hero Speeches from hero to hero usually come up whenever a heros Designated Hero status becomes irritating to the other protagonist or they feel that the hero being called out must be taken down a peg or more This is also occasionally done in Good Versus Good scenarios where a protagonists morality is being called into question by another protagonist who doesnt agree with their methods It usually takes place following a hero doing something particularly unheroic or if their general unpleasantness has gone past the point of acceptance Often doubles as What Were You Thinking and What the Hell Hero and in particularly bad circumstances it may cause allies to turn against one another    An AcquaintanceFriend Addresses Another AcquaintanceFriend This speech is given by someone whos just frustrated with the other person This is not an attempt to bring down or break an opponent This is not an exchange between heroes and villains heck they might even be friends This is someone tired of everything they have to deal with giving a frank and brutally honest assessment of the person theyre dealing with often in a What the Hell Hero moment This can be prone to backfire with a suitably shallow selfobsessed andor savvy target who typically responds with Youve just listed all of my best features Other times however the one who gave the speech overreacted and says that they are too harsh and its not really how they feel Will often provoke an attempted refutation or justification from the target which depending on the source can be played for comedy drama or Wangst If the target is a Designated Hero this occurrence just might motivate them to become a real hero    A Protagonist Calls Out Themselves Sometimes a protagonist in a particular shows is so filled with selfloathing that when prompted decide that theyre fed up with themselves and calls out the worst of villains themselves If done in a comedy or a Dramedy this is usually Played for Laughs However in other cases this is almost always done for drama This might be because the hero is suffering Heroic BSoD or might have implied or explicitly stated to suffer Depression This is the ultimate form of SelfDeprecation in a work Of course this could also be done to get people to sympathize with the protagonist    Someone Calls Out the Crowd The indulgences of the crowd disgusts the speaker to such an extent that they must speak out against it Calling everyone in attendance for their failures in life in a cruel but often necessary manner If it gets meta and is directed at the audience it also counts as You BastardOne thing all seven types of speech have in common is that the speaker has a point even if theyre villains To give a speech about it the speaker has to have thought it through and can usually have more than one reason why you suck This is because the writer of the story has also thought it through This is a sister trope to Calling the Old Man Out or Calling the Old Woman Out Compare Talking the Monster to Death where this is meant to kill or redeem a villain Could also be a Take That Scrappy where someone tells a hated character what the audience feels about them This can lead to failure if the character receiving the speech Cant Take Criticism Can also overlap with a Cowardice Callout which is when someone calls someone else out for fearbased shortcomingsCompare and contrast the No More Holding Back Speech which may incorporate elements of this See also Did You Actually Believe and Youre Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum An ArmorPiercing Response can provide a short but effective way of calling someone out Put to music this is The Diss Track and can become a The Villain Sucks Song or The Hero Sucks Song ForeignLanguage Tirade is quite fittingly a foreignlanguage variant of this tropeContrast Minor Insult Meltdown where just the tip of the you suck iceberg can sink someone to tears Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark See also Compassionate Critic and Constructive CriticismLastly no this isnt the trope thats about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You Finally youll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches too  \n",

                            Its very sweet until you realize how many hidden cameras he had to set up to get all this— Bill Corbett Batman  Robin RiffTraxIn many situations where someone watches a recording of an event that the audience has already seen happening the recording will — by the purest coincidence — happen to use exactly the same footage that the audience has already witnessed That is to say it will include all the same dramatic camera angles pans and zooms as the original scene despite that theres no way an inuniverse device especially a stationary device like a fixed security camera could have captured and produced such well cinematic footageEven if not recycled footage there are other elements used to produce a similar results including Perfect composition especially notable on a panning camera keeping perfect pace with the subject They are rarely standing in the upper right corner of the screen with their back turned Cinematic angles as most security cameras are stationed near the ceiling looking down not making it very effective in showing a closeup of an actor Even the footage of an InUniverse camcorder using Jitter Cam can make you wonder why the subjects arent aware they are being recorded Dynamic editing letting us jump in at the best part Especially helpful with paring down the footage from multiple cameras as even just a splitscreen means someone had to sync it up Image resolution and sound quality on par with nonsecurity cam footage Even in the modern era of 4K cameras many security cameras used today still produce lowresolution images that can even make it difficult to make out facial detail Smooth continuous video A camera that continuously records and saves high resolution high frame rate video will run out of storage space in short order Even today security cameras tend to have very low frame rates you only need a few frames per second to be able to at least tell what is going on and often only save footage when movement is detectedSometimes this is Hand Waved by overlaying visual effects on the recording — conversion to blackandwhite simulated scanning lines a datetime stamp or watermark meaningless computerese advanced technology where cameras can be anywhere and so on this still doesnt change the fact that the movie isnt attempting to recreate the scene as it would actually appear to the inuniverse device This is only averted in science fiction settings where the footage is often a holographic recording instead allowing the characters to directly observe the incidentSee also Magical Computer Caught on Tape Compare Surveillance as the Plot Demands where the footage is equally implausible but due to location How did they get a camera on the moon and not necessarily the angles For security cams that are actually magical see Magical Camera  "

several contexts in which this can happen    openclose all folders      A Villain Addresses a Hero Not only has the Big Bad killed your Love Interest slain the Team Pet and finally taken over the world they must grind your selfworth into the asphalt and explain to you why you failed to stop their Evil Plan This is where they list all the reasons you are a poor excuse for a heroine and never had a prayer of stopping them you lack the skills the weapons and the powers needed you childishly fight for outdated ideals your costume is ugly and your mentor always hated youFrequently a brand of Evil Gloating andor Break Them by Talking In a welldone speech the villain will state things that the hero and audience cant argue with and when the fight is done the hero stays troubled because the Villain Has a Point However maybe theyre total BS but its delivered with such conviction it almost makes the hero and audience agree that they were wrong to have dared challenge the villain in the first placeSometimes it makes the point that the people the hero are trying to defend arent worth the trouble An especially arrogant Big Bad will use this to let the hero know theyre just a lesser version of the Big Bad himself and the only difference is theyre not saddled with morals A villain going for a lowblow might bring up some previous encounter between the two when they overpowered the hero as to state that the same thing will happen again What You Are in the Dark can and often does followMaybe the hero hurt the villain in the past or even caused their Start of Darkness maybe they abandoned them believed they were dead made them feel like theyd been replaced etc This will be what the villain addresses in this speech reminding the hero of everything theyve done to hurt them The hero might even be affected by this and have no good responseA hero worth their salt might respond with their own speech along the lines of a No More Holding Back Speech or a Picard or Kirk Summation among others If its an action movie the hero will usually say Shut Up Hannibal and then declare what and who they truly are Sometimes the hero survives only because theyre Not Worth Killing in which case theyll invariably prove that they are later in the story Often a Moment of Awesome if a Jerkass gives this to someone and they respond with a better one    A Hero Addresses a Villain Heroes can also give defeated villains The Reason You Suck Speeches often pointing out their wasted potential their callous nature and a lack of any altruistic quality or how their obsession with defeating the hero has ruined them or in the case of the WellIntentioned Extremist adversary how theyve become everything theyve fought against or how their extremes in trying to bring a better world have done more to ruin it Heroic The Reason You Suck Speeches come out when the heros not going to bother with the Kirk Summation Chances are they tried the diplomatic option and it didnt sink inA villain will usually respond by entering a Villainous Breakdown upon realizing the heros words have a grain of truth to them and being unable to stand it The WellIntentioned Extremist may acknowledge it but then state Ive Come Too Far Sometimes the villain will say Shut Up Kirk and mock them for thinking they could be swayed by mere words    A Villain Addresses Another Villain Villains can also give this to other villains on an Evil Versus Evil stage The content of this speech is usually along the lines of how theyre Eviler than Thou and pointing out flaws and shortcomings in the other villain like the Magnificent Bastard or Bitch chiding a Smug Snake a CardCarrying Villain mocking a Knight Templar for employing the same methods but believing their actions to be right and just a calculating practitioner of Pragmatic Villainy berating a Stupid Evil villain for being too sadistic to actually achieve anything or in a conflict between the Evil Genius and The Brute have the Evil Genius mock the Brute for using brute force to compensate for their low intelligence and explain their simplemindedness makes him predictable and as such easy to beat or the Brute pointing out how the Evil Genius relies on their minions and Humongous Mecha to fight their battles and for all their vaunted intelligence they cant make any of their big schemes stickAlternatively it could take the form of Even Evil Has Standards if the other villain did something they find completely unnecessary and appalling If two or more Professional Killers are hired to track down the heroes a Psycho for Hire can get this from a Hitman with a Heart who voices their disgust at the formers capacity for torture rape and enjoyment of destruction and killing or a Consummate Professional who loses patience with how their psychotic tendencies draw unwanted attention and their distaste for taking the simple approach makes the mission needlessly complicated If the Big Bad crosses the Moral Event Horizon the Noble Top Enforcer may drop one explaining how they were let down by their boss and feel betrayed by the one they looked up to before they quit A Defector from Decadence may give one against their entire country before they leave and if two villains team up to fight the heroes one of them may eventually break off their partnership with one of these as a way of establishing them as the Lighter Shade of Black Either way it can be a Moment of Awesome when the person on the receiving end has it comingThis form often doubles as a way to explain the reasoning behind a Villainous Rescue without Leaning on the Fourth Wall too hard    A Hero Addresses Another Hero Speeches from hero to hero usually come up whenever a heros Designated Hero status becomes irritating to the other protagonist or they feel that the hero being called out must be taken down a peg or more This is also occasionally done in Good Versus Good scenarios where a protagonists morality is being called into question by another protagonist who doesnt agree with their methods It usually takes place following a hero doing something particularly unheroic or if their general unpleasantness has gone past the point of acceptance Often doubles as What Were You Thinking and What the Hell Hero and in particularly bad circumstances it may cause allies to turn against one another    An AcquaintanceFriend Addresses Another AcquaintanceFriend This speech is given by someone whos just frustrated with the other person This is not an attempt to bring down or break an opponent This is not an exchange between heroes and villains heck they might even be friends This is someone tired of everything they have to deal with giving a frank and brutally honest assessment of the person theyre dealing with often in a What the Hell Hero moment This can be prone to backfire with a suitably shallow selfobsessed andor savvy target who typically responds with Youve just listed all of my best features Other times however the one who gave the speech overreacted and says that they are too harsh and its not really how they feel Will often provoke an attempted refutation or justification from the target which depending on the source can be played for comedy drama or Wangst If the target is a Designated Hero this occurrence just might motivate them to become a real hero    A Protagonist Calls Out Themselves Sometimes a protagonist in a particular shows is so filled with selfloathing that when prompted decide that theyre fed up with themselves and calls out the worst of villains themselves If done in a comedy or a Dramedy this is usually Played for Laughs However in other cases this is almost always done for drama This might be because the hero is suffering Heroic BSoD or might have implied or explicitly stated to suffer Depression This is the ultimate form of SelfDeprecation in a work Of course this could also be done to get people to sympathize with the protagonist    Someone Calls Out the Crowd The indulgences of the crowd disgusts the speaker to such an extent that they must speak out against it Calling everyone in attendance for their failures in life in a cruel but often necessary manner If it gets meta and is directed at the audience it also counts as You BastardOne thing all seven types of speech have in common is that the speaker has a point even if theyre villains To give a speech about it the speaker has to have thought it through and can usually have more than one reason why you suck This is because the writer of the story has also thought it through This is a sister trope to Calling the Old Man Out or Calling the Old Woman Out Compare Talking the Monster to Death where this is meant to kill or redeem a villain Could also be a Take That Scrappy where someone tells a hated character what the audience feels about them This can lead to failure if the character receiving the speech Cant Take Criticism Can also overlap with a Cowardice Callout which is when someone calls someone else out for fearbased shortcomingsCompare and contrast the No More Holding Back Speech which may incorporate elements of this See also Did You Actually Believe and Youre Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum An ArmorPiercing Response can provide a short but effective way of calling someone out Put to music this is The Diss Track and can become a The Villain Sucks Song or The Hero Sucks Song ForeignLanguage Tirade is quite fittingly a foreignlanguage variant of this tropeContrast Minor Insult Meltdown where just the tip of the you suck iceberg can sink someone to tears Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark See also Compassionate Critic and Constructive CriticismLastly no this isnt the trope thats about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You Finally youll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches too</td>\n",

               Just another Tuesday for Princess Peach Its time I gave you a proper thankyou Pucker up handsome— Flurrie Paper Mario The ThousandYear DoorMy hero mwahSome men quest for glory fame and riches Some men seek power and strength Some want To Be a MasterAnd some guys just want a kiss from the princess theyre trying to saveFor some strange reason princesses and other Love Interests seem to love giving out kisses as rewards for helping them The smooch of victory is a standard part of the Rescue Romance but it can appear in almost any scenario where a guy has the potential to impress a girl—either by winning a contest saving her from a horrible beast recovering her purse from thugs or whatever the plot writers think up The scenario generally goes like this Alice is in trouble Bob vows to help her Alternatively Bob is entering a contest He vows to win for Alices sake Bob overcomes obstacles goes through many trials and goes through hell and back for Alice He eventually saves Alice or reaches his goal Alice says to Bob Oh Bob How can I ever thank you Alice then proceeds to show Bob exactly how she can thank him by giving him lipstick imprints right on the face If this is Bobs first Big Damn Heroes moment it will often result in PostKiss CatatoniaMay also occur in an AfterAction PatchUp in which case she may merely acknowledge his courage first — or may berate him for stupidly getting into the matter firstUsually Bob is a Nice Guy and hes perfectly content with receiving a kiss as his reward If hes lucky he might even get a fullon makeout session with the girl he just helped If hes not well even a chaste kiss on the cheek is pretty sweet Sometimes though Bob might be a lech whos only trying to help the girl in the hopes of lockin lips with her Thus this is one of those frequently invoked tropesThe most common ways to play with this trope are to have the kissee not want the kiss for some reason and try his darndest not to get it Alternatively if he goes into the rescue or competition expecting a kiss the girl at the other end may well refuse to give him one The question of why its desired if its out of obligation and thus doesnt actually mean anything may not be addressed A growing number of examples exists where both parties are the same sex if only for the sake of a quick jokeNote that in many historical settings kissing an eligible member of the opposite sex is Serious Business it may go all the way up to being tantamount to a marriage proposalSometimes it might be unplanned or the victory coincides with the resolving of their UST When prefaced with aggression its SlapSlapKissOne of the most popular methods of Ship Teasing Can overlap with The Big Damn Kiss if Rescue Romance is involvedIf the smooch is given by a damsel after being

It This Way—is the polar opposite of Appeal to Novelty where the older position is right See also They Changed It Now It Sucks Nostalgia Filter Older Is Better Ludd Was Right Good Old Ways and New Media Are Evil This tends to be rolled out regarding consumer products and morality in the former case they dont make em like they used to and in the latter it was better in the good ol days Old ways do tend to be workable or they dont become old ways in the first place what makes this a fallacy is the unstated assumption that no better way is possible See also Culture Justifies Anything and Nobody Ever Complained Before Quite similar to Appeal to Nature Cases of They Changed It Now It Sucks often fall into this fallacy eg Character x has always had blue eyes before so changing her eyes to green is bad   \n",
       "3  I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing But now that I see you I think I understand Theres just nothing inside you Nothing at all Youre pathetic and sad and empty— Katara Avatar The Last Airbender to her mothers murdererSomeone delivers a speech to another character on all the reasons why that other character sucks or is a horrible person There are several contexts in which this can happen    openclose all folders      A Villain Addresses a Hero Not only has the Big Bad killed your Love Interest slain the Team Pet and finally taken over the world they must grind your selfworth into the asphalt and explain to you why you failed to stop their Evil Plan This is where they list all the reasons you are a poor excuse for a heroine and never had a prayer of stopping them you lack the skills the weapons and the powers needed you childishly fight for outdated ideals your costume is ugly and your mentor always hated youFrequently a brand of Evil Gloating andor Break Them by Talking In a welldone speech the villain will state things that the hero and audience cant argue with and when the fight is done the hero stays troubled because the Villain Has a Point However maybe theyre total BS but its delivered with such conviction it almost makes the hero and audience agree that they were wrong to have dared challenge the villain in the first placeSometimes it makes the point that the people the hero are trying to defend arent worth the trouble An especially arrogant Big Bad will use this to let the hero know theyre just a lesser version of the Big Bad himself and the only difference is theyre not saddled with morals A villain going for a lowblow might bring up some previous encounter between the two when they overpowered the hero as to state that the same thing will happen again What You Are in the Dark can and often does followMaybe the hero hurt the villain in the past or even caused their Start of Darkness maybe they abandoned them believed they were dead made them feel like theyd been replaced etc This will be what the villain addresses in this speech reminding the hero of everything theyve done to hurt them The hero might even be affected by this and have no good responseA hero worth their salt might respond with their own speech along the lines of a No More Holding Back Speech or a Picard or Kirk Summation among others If its an action movie the hero will usually say Shut Up Hannibal and then declare what and who they truly are Sometimes the hero survives only because theyre Not Worth Killing in which case theyll invariably prove that they are later in the story Often a Moment of Awesome if a Jerkass gives this to someone and they respond with a better one    A Hero Addresses a Villain Heroes can also give defeated villains The Reason You Suck Speeches often pointing out their wasted potential their callous nature and a lack of any altruistic quality or how their obsession with defeating the hero has ruined them or in the case of the WellIntentioned Extremist adversary how theyve become everything theyve fought against or how their extremes in trying to bring a better world have done more to ruin it Heroic The Reason You Suck Speeches come out when the heros not going to bother with the Kirk Summation Chances are they tried the diplomatic option and it didnt sink inA villain will usually respond by entering a Villainous Breakdown upon realizing the heros words have a grain of truth to them and being unable to stand it The WellIntentioned Extremist may acknowledge it but then state Ive Come Too Far Sometimes the villain will say Shut Up Kirk and mock them for thinking they could be swayed by mere words    A Villain Addresses Another Villain Villains can also give this to other villains on an Evil Versus Evil stage The content of this speech is usually along the lines of how theyre Eviler than Thou and pointing out flaws and shortcomings in the other villain like the Magnificent Bastard or Bitch chiding a Smug Snake a CardCarrying Villain mocking a Knight Templar for employing the same methods but believing their actions to be right and just a calculating practitioner of Pragmatic Villainy berating a Stupid Evil villain for being too sadistic to actually achieve anything or in a conflict between the Evil Genius and The Brute have the Evil Genius mock the Brute for using brute force to compensate for their low intelligence and explain their simplemindedness makes him predictable and as such easy to beat or the Brute pointing out how the Evil Genius relies on their minions and Humongous Mecha to fight their battles and for all their vaunted intelligence they cant make any of their big schemes stickAlternatively it could take the form of Even Evil Has Standards if the other villain did something they find completely unnecessary and appalling If two or more Professional Killers are hired to track down the heroes a Psycho for Hire can get this from a Hitman with a Heart who voices their disgust at the formers capacity for torture rape and enjoyment of destruction and killing or a Consummate Professional who loses patience with how their psychotic tendencies draw unwanted attention and their distaste for taking the simple approach makes the mission needlessly complicated If the Big Bad crosses the Moral Event Horizon the Noble Top Enforcer may drop one explaining how they were let down by their boss and feel betrayed by the one they looked up to before they quit A Defector from Decadence may give one against their entire country before they leave and if two villains team up to fight the heroes one of them may eventually break off their partnership with one of these as a way of establishing them as the Lighter Shade of Black Either way it can be a Moment of Awesome when the person on the receiving end has it comingThis form often doubles as a way to explain the reasoning behind a Villainous Rescue without Leaning on the Fourth Wall too hard    A Hero Addresses Another Hero Speeches from hero to hero usually come up whenever a heros Designated Hero status becomes irritating to the other protagonist or they feel that the hero being called out must be taken down a peg or more This is also occasionally done in Good Versus Good scenarios where a protagonists morality is being called into question by another protagonist who doesnt agree with their methods It usually takes place following a hero doing something particularly unheroic or if their general unpleasantness has gone past the point of acceptance Often doubles as What Were You Thinking and What the Hell Hero and in particularly bad circumstances it may cause allies to turn against one another    An AcquaintanceFriend Addresses Another AcquaintanceFriend This speech is given by someone whos just frustrated with the other person This is not an attempt to bring down or break an opponent This is not an exchange between heroes and villains heck they might even be friends This is someone tired of everything they have to deal with giving a frank and brutally honest assessment of the person theyre dealing with often in a What the Hell Hero moment This can be prone to backfire with a suitably shallow selfobsessed andor savvy target who typically responds with Youve just listed all of my best features Other times however the one who gave the speech overreacted and says that they are too harsh and its not really how they feel Will often provoke an attempted refutation or justification from the target which depending on the source can be played for comedy drama or Wangst If the target is a Designated Hero this occurrence just might motivate them to become a real hero    A Protagonist Calls Out Themselves Sometimes a protagonist in a particular shows is so filled with selfloathing that when prompted decide that theyre fed up with themselves and calls out the worst of villains themselves If done in a comedy or a Dramedy this is usually Played for Laughs However in other cases this is almost always done for drama This might be because the hero is suffering Heroic BSoD or might have implied or explicitly stated to suffer Depression This is the ultimate form of SelfDeprecation in a work Of course this could also be done to get people to sympathize with the protagonist    Someone Calls Out the Crowd The indulgences of the crowd disgusts the speaker to such an extent that they must speak out against it Calling everyone in attendance for their failures in life in a cruel but often necessary manner If it gets meta and is directed at the audience it also counts as You BastardOne thing all seven types of speech have in common is that the speaker has a point even if theyre villains To give a speech about it the speaker has to have thought it through and can usually have more than one reason why you suck This is because the writer of the story has also thought it through This is a sister trope to Calling the Old Man Out or Calling the Old Woman Out Compare Talking the Monster to Death where this is meant to kill or redeem a villain Could also be a Take That Scrappy where someone tells a hated character what the audience feels about them This can lead to failure if the character receiving the speech Cant Take Criticism Can also overlap with a Cowardice Callout which is when someone calls someone else out for fearbased shortcomingsCompare and contrast the No More Holding Back Speech which may incorporate elements of this See also Did You Actually Believe and Youre Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum An ArmorPiercing Response can provide a short but effective way of calling someone out Put to music this is The Diss Track and can become a The Villain Sucks Song or The Hero Sucks Song ForeignLanguage Tirade is quite fittingly a foreignlanguage variant of this tropeContrast Minor Insult Meltdown where just the tip of the you suck iceberg can sink someone to tears Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark See also Compassionate Critic and Constructive CriticismLastly no this isnt the trope thats about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You Finally youll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches too   \n",

                            Its very sweet until you realize how many hidden cameras he had to set up to get all this— Bill Corbett Batman  Robin RiffTraxIn many situations where someone watches a recording of an event that the audience has already seen happening the recording will — by the purest coincidence — happen to use exactly the same footage that the audience has already witnessed That is to say it will include all the same dramatic camera angles pans and zooms as the original scene despite that theres no way an inuniverse device especially a stationary device like a fixed security camera could have captured and produced such well cinematic footageEven if not recycled footage there are other elements used to produce a similar results including Perfect composition especially notable on a panning camera keeping perfect pace with the subject They are rarely standing in the upper right corner of the screen with their back turned Cinematic angles as most security cameras are stationed near the ceiling looking down not making it very effective in showing a closeup of an actor Even the footage of an InUniverse camcorder using Jitter Cam can make you wonder why the subjects arent aware they are being recorded Dynamic editing letting us jump in at the best part Especially helpful with paring down the footage from multiple cameras as even just a splitscreen means someone had to sync it up Image resolution and sound quality on par with nonsecurity cam footage Even in the modern era of 4K cameras many security cameras used today still produce lowresolution images that can even make it difficult to make out facial detail Smooth continuous video A camera that continuously records and saves high resolution high frame rate video will run out of storage space in short order Even today security cameras tend to have very low frame rates you only need a few frames per second to be able to at least tell what is going on and often only save footage when movement is detectedSometimes this is Hand Waved by overlaying visual effects on the recording — conversion to blackandwhite simulated scanning lines a datetime stamp or watermark meaningless computerese advanced technology where cameras can be anywhere and so on this still doesnt change the fact that the movie isnt attempting to recreate the scene as it would actually appear to the inuniverse device This is only averted in science fiction settings where the footage is often a holographic recording instead allowing the characters to directly observe the incidentSee also Magical Computer Caught on Tape Compare Surveillance as the Plot Demands where the footage is equally implausible but due to location How did they get a camera on the moon and not necessarily the angles For security cams that are actually magical see Magical Camera   \n",
