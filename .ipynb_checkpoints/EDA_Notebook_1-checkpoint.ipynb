      "top     Homer hastily drives the Family Sedan with Marge and Maggie through a snowcovered street They are late for Bart and Lisas Christmas pageant at Springfield Elementary School After crashing into a pile of snow at the front of Springfield Elementary School park Homer and Marge stumble through a full audience to find their seats Homer and Marge sit down just in time to see Principal Skinner introduce the second grade The children do a presentation of different Santa Clauses from around the world such as Ralph Wiggum as Hotei Oshō Dewey Largo introduces Lisa playing Tawanga the Santa Claus of the South Seas Lisa’s dance causes awe throughout the crowd Lisa performs a skilled dance with lit torches performing tricks such as throwing it around herself – Lisa also wears seethrough clothing effectively ‘revealing Lisa completely at the end of her act Skinner eventually introduces the fourth grade singing Christmas carols Jingle Bells is sung first and after the first verse Bart picks up his voice volume during the chorus and sings a Batmanthemed parody causing an irate Skinner to withdraw Bart from the performance Homer gives a disappointed look for Barts actions but as the pageant continues he grows bored and wonders aloud how long the pageant will lastAt the Simpson family home Marge writes a letter for the Simpson family Christmas cards as Homer gets out Christmas decorations and Bart and Lisa write their Christmas wish lists In the letter Marge describes family life As she reads the letter Marges narration describes her writing the camera pans around to the different family members as she mentions their names and stories Marge soon stops writing due to Homers grumpy demeanor Bart and Lisa show Marge their wish lists Marge is uncomfortable when Lisa once again asks for a pony for Christmas but Lisa remains optimistic about her present request Marge plans to read Barts letter to Santa hoping he would be a bit more reasonable However he proves to be the same as Lisa when he asks for a tattoo which escalates into a debate among Homer Marge and Bart Homer and Marge quickly refuse to let Bart have one regardless They are interrupted by a phone call Homer answers to Patty who refuses to speak with him requesting Marge a grumbling Homer hands the phone over to Marge and the two sisters discuss their plans Christmas Eve—the sisters also find time to criticize Marges choice in a husbandHomer is outside adding the finishing touches to the Christmas lights on the roof while the three children watch Homer falls from the roof lands in the snow and calls out to Marge to power the lights Only a few of the lights actually light up and Homer admires his handy work while the kids are less than impressed Ned Flanders is also outside along with Todd Flanders and ready to plug in his lights for the first time he calls out to Homer and tells him to admire his superiority As he plugs the lights in the entire Flanders house lights up including a talking Santa Claus on the roof The lights illuminate everyones faces and much to Homers dismay his kids are very impressed at Neds display of lights yet Homer still manages to criticize Neds work obviously jealous over the fact Neds display is better than his ownMarge tells the kids to grab their money so they can go Christmas shopping at the Springfield Mall As the excited kids run off to get their money Homer asks Marge where she has been keeping the Christmas savings She makes him turn around and she pulls a jar out of her hair It is a very large jar full of money impressing Homer Later at the mall Marge Lisa and Maggie look at gifts together Bart is off by himself and comes across The Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor In the window he sees a tattoo of a heart with the word “mother” written across it He imagines that Marge will have a positive reaction to him getting a tattoo so he runs inside the parlor gives false information to the tattoo artist Mervin Monroe about his age and gets into the chairAt the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Mr Burns the plants owner and rightful boss announces over the loudspeaker that there will not be any Christmas bonuses this year for unskilled workers including Homer Homer sighs as he remembers they still have the big jar full of money for Christmas presents Back at the mall Marge hears Barts yells of pain coming from inside the tattoo parlor and she quickly runs inside to see Bart with the heart tattoo practically finished on his arm She quickly pulls him out of the chair and takes him to Dr Zitsofskys Dermatology Clinic The tattoo removal is expensive and requires a full cash payment up front Marge decides to use all the Christmas money for Barts tattoo removal although unhappy she assumes Homers Christmas bonus will cover future costs Bart then undergoes a “James Bond”style operation Back at home Lisa tells Homer what has happened and Homer freaks out Marge tells him to calm down and that they will just have to stretch his Christmas bonus further for the year Homer fakes relief when Marge mentions his bonus he tells everyone that this will be the best Christmas ever and steps outside for a walk choosing to conceal the truth Once outside he looks at his poorly decorated house and then at Flanders masterpiece A depressed Homer hangs his head in despair on the sidewalkMarge senses something is amiss with Homer and asks if there is something wrong Homer almost tells her the truth about his Christmas bonus but quickly backpedals and instead offers to do the Christmas shopping so she doesnt have to Marge agrees and is content with Homers answer the two sleep The next day Homer does the Christmas shopping alone at Circus of Values He purchases pantyhose for Marge pads of paper for Bart and a squeaky chew toy for Maggie While purchasing such dismal presents Homer uses empty optimism to assure his own self On his way out the door with his bag of presents Homer accidentally crashes into Ned and Todd while he carries an armful of fancily wrapped packages All the presents are spilled onto the ground and as Homer picks the few he purchased and sees how many Ned bought Ned attempts to sort the presents unintentionally gloating his wealth At Moes Tavern Homer drinks a beer alone when a cheerful Barney arrives wearing a Santa Claus costume Barney explains that he is in a good mood because he has extra money from working a parttime job acting as a department store Santa at the mall Homer suddenly has an idea so he goes to the personnel office in the mall where he fills out an application and is interviewed to be a mall Santa After he finishes reviewing Homers application as well as interviewing him the personnel director welcomes Homer aboard and sends him to mall Santa training A montage of Homer enduring Santa training ensues with the Hypnotist as the teacherHomer finally gets home late at night and a worried Marge wants to know where he has been Homer assures the insignificance of his tardiness and heads upstairs but Marge tells him they have guests Patty and Selma As Homer talks to Patty and Selma they comment on the fact that the Simpsons dont have a Christmas tree up yet Homer gives false information and tells them he was about to leave and he rushes out the door In the car Homer drives past several Christmas tree lots gradually the trees become cheaper from the earlier expensive ones Eventually he stops at a private Christmas Tree Farm and uses a chainsaw to steal a nice Christmas tree for the family Homer is soon met with retaliation the farm owner fires his gun upon Homer and has two hounds pursue However Homer escapes relatively easily Back at home Homer stands up the tree and everyone is impressed except for Patty and Selma On Christmas Eve at the mall Homer works as Santa Claus while children wait in line to sit on his lap one being a very greedy child From a distance Bart Milhouse and Lewis watch the children line up to sit on Santas lap while they comment on the gullibility of the kids Milhouse dares Bart to yank off Santas beard and Bart agrees Bart jumps in line and finally gets his turn on Santas lap Not knowing that Santa is really Homer Bart yanks off his beard Bart is surprised at what he uncovers and Homer escorts Bart into Santas workshop for speaking in private leaving Alfie to cover for him Homer explains the situation to Bart who understands and feels terrible for pulling Homers beard offBart goes with Homer as he picks up his check Homer is surprised to learn that his net pay is only 13 despite his 120 gross pay When he questions the cashier she explains the majority of his check went to pay for the Santa suit and beard social security unemployment insurance training and Christmas club account balance While a depressed Homer sits down to figure out what to do with the 13 an excited Barney tells Homer that he is going to the Springfield Downs to place a bet with his earnings He invites Homer to come along with him ensuring a win on the dog Whirlwind Homer is reluctant but Bart convinces him to go citing that this might be their only chance to save the Simpson family ChristmasPatty Selma Abe Simpson Marge Maggie and Lisa wait for Homer and Bart to come home while watching a The Happy Little Elves Christmas special Meanwhile at the dog track Barney insists Homer should bet on Whirlwind After seeing what Whirlwind looks like Homer is reluctant to bet on him Just then an announcement plays over the PA system a dog named Santas Little Helper will be replacing Sir Galahad in the fourth race Bart senses that the announcement is an omen and chooses to ask Homer to bet on him and despite the fact that the odds are ninetynine to one which means that the dogs winning chances are extremely rare Homer puts down all 13 on Santas Little Helper Meanwhile at home Patty and Selma talk bad about Homer while everyone waits for him and Bart Lisa then explains to Patty how her bad mouthing will damage herself confusing Patty Back at the track Homer and Bart anxiously await the running of the fourth race As the race begins Homer and Bart cheer on Santas Little Helper but Whirlwind Barneys pick is out to an early lead with Santas Little Helper bringing up the rear Homer and Bart quickly realize their chances at winning any money are dashed as Santas Little Helper finishes lastHomer and Bart look for discarded betting slips hoping to find one that has been thrown away with a winner but to no avail A dejected Bart and Homer head back to their car when off in the distance they see Les a racing dog owner scolding Santas Little Helper and sending him away for losing once again Santas Little Helper leaps up into Homers arms Bart asks Homer if they can keep the dog Homer reluctant at first quickly warms up to the dog and plans to take him home Back at the Simpson home while everyone still awaits Bart and Homers return a sadlooking Homer arrives and starts to confess to everyone about the fact that he didnt receive his Christmas bonus and apologizes for the lack of presents However Bart interrupts Homer by introducing the family to Santas Little Helper and watches the hound run into the room barking Everyone ignores Homer and falls in love with Santas Little Helper Marge forgives Homer and he realizes that in the end he has

Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L Brooks office Brooks the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series However when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his lifes work he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family5The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 19876 Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production However the animators merely retraced his drawings which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes7 In 1989 a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a halfhour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the shows content8 Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he had called the mainstream trash that they were watching9 The halfhour series premiered on December 17 1989 with Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire1Barney as a blondFox was very nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audiences attention for the duration of the episode In the end they gambled by asking for 13 fulllength episodes The series was originally planned to premiere in the fall of 1989 but due to major problems with the animation of Some Enchanted Evening the first Simpsons episode produced the series instead began on December 17 1989 with Some Enchanted Evening instead aired as the season finaleThe episode being the first to air lacked the now famous opening sequence which was later added in the second episode when Groening thought of the idea of a longer opening sequence resulting in less animationThe Santas of many lands portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Matt Groenings experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia Groening also used that reference in his strip Life in Hell when he spoofed himself as a young man being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia because Christmas is against the law there Also Matt Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the alternate version of Jingle BellsThe first appearance of Moe and Moes TavernThe episode was written by Mimi Pond David Silverman directed this episode although Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Flanders Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani brother of Gwen StefaniIn this episode Barney had yellow hair which was the same color as his skin but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair There are also many other major differences in appearances throughout the episode including Moe Moes Tavern and Ralph WiggumThe episode also marks the first appearances of Moe Barney Patty and Selma Abe Simpson Ned and Todd Flanders Milhouse Van Houten Lewis Seymour Skinner Sherri and Terri Wendell Borton Mr Burns Dewey Largo Ralph Wiggum Santas Little Helper Snowball II and Santas Little Helpers original owner Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers is heard for the first timeThe episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming less than One Hour and Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special Because Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire is considered to be a separate special The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category the episode lost to the fellow episode Life on the Fast LaneSince the first airing Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire has received mostly positive criticism The authors of I Cant Believe Its a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively of the episode pretty standard early fare with the series not quite hitting its stride The Realism of the first season is much apparent with only the laser used to remove Barts tattoo hinting at what the series will becomeIn its original broadcast the episode finished thirtieth in the week of December 11–17 1989 It concluded with a Nielsen rating of 145 and was viewed in approximately 134 million homes   \n",
