Appeal to Tradition,And how do we keep our balance That I can tell you in one word— Tevye Fiddler on the RoofAppeal to Tradition—also called Appeal to Antiquity or Weve Always Done It This Way—is the polar opposite of Appeal to Novelty where the older position is right See also They Changed It Now It Sucks Nostalgia Filter Older Is Better Ludd Was Right Good Old Ways and New Media Are Evil This tends to be rolled out regarding consumer products and morality in the former case they dont make em like they used to and in the latter it was better in the good ol days Old ways do tend to be workable or they dont become old ways in the first place what makes this a fallacy is the unstated assumption that no better way is possible See also Culture Justifies Anything and Nobody Ever Complained Before Quite similar to Appeal to Nature Cases of They Changed It Now It Sucks often fall into this fallacy eg Character x has always had blue eyes before so changing her eyes to green is bad,967
The Reason You Suck Speech                    aka Reason You Suck Speech,I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing But now that I see you I think I understand Theres just nothing inside you Nothing at all Youre pathetic and sad and empty— Katara Avatar The Last Airbender to her mothers murdererSomeone delivers a speech to another character on all the reasons why that other character sucks or is a horrible person There are several contexts in which this can happen    openclose all folders      A Villain Addresses a Hero Not only has the Big Bad killed your Love Interest slain the Team Pet and finally taken over the world they must grind your selfworth into the asphalt and explain to you why you failed to stop their Evil Plan This is where they list all the reasons you are a poor excuse for a heroine and never had a prayer of stopping them you lack the skills the weapons and the powers needed you childishly fight for outdated ideals your costume is ugly and your mentor always hated youFrequently a brand of Evil Gloating andor Break Them by Talking In a welldone speech the villain will state things that the hero and audience cant argue with and when the fight is done the hero stays troubled because the Villain Has a Point However maybe theyre total BS but its delivered with such conviction it almost makes the hero and audience agree that they were wrong to have dared challenge the villain in the first placeSometimes it makes the point that the people the hero are trying to defend arent worth the trouble An especially arrogant Big Bad will use this to let the hero know theyre just a lesser version of the Big Bad himself and the only difference is theyre not saddled with morals A villain going for a lowblow might bring up some previous encounter between the two when they overpowered the hero as to state that the same thing will happen again What You Are in the Dark can and often does followMaybe the hero hurt the villain in the past or even caused their Start of Darkness maybe they abandoned them believed they were dead made them feel like theyd been replaced etc This will be what the villain addresses in this speech reminding the hero of everything theyve done to hurt them The hero might even be affected by this and have no good responseA hero worth their salt might respond with their own speech along the lines of a No More Holding Back Speech or a Picard or Kirk Summation among others If its an action movie the hero will usually say Shut Up Hannibal and then declare what and who they truly are Sometimes the hero survives only because theyre Not Worth Killing in which case theyll invariably prove that they are later in the story Often a Moment of Awesome if a Jerkass gives this to someone and they respond with a better one    A Hero Addresses a Villain Heroes can also give defeated villains The Reason You Suck Speeches often pointing out their wasted potential their callous nature and a lack of any altruistic quality or how their obsession with defeating the hero has ruined them or in the case of the WellIntentioned Extremist adversary how theyve become everything theyve fought against or how their extremes in trying to bring a better world have done more to ruin it Heroic The Reason You Suck Speeches come out when the heros not going to bother with the Kirk Summation Chances are they tried the diplomatic option and it didnt sink inA villain will usually respond by entering a Villainous Breakdown upon realizing the heros words have a grain of truth to them and being unable to stand it The WellIntentioned Extremist may acknowledge it but then state Ive Come Too Far Sometimes the villain will say Shut Up Kirk and mock them for thinking they could be swayed by mere words    A Villain Addresses Another Villain Villains can also give this to other villains on an Evil Versus Evil stage The content of this speech is usually along the lines of how theyre Eviler than Thou and pointing out flaws and shortcomings in the other villain like the Magnificent Bastard or Bitch chiding a Smug Snake a CardCarrying Villain mocking a Knight Templar for employing the same methods but believing their actions to be right and just a calculating practitioner of Pragmatic Villainy berating a Stupid Evil villain for being too sadistic to actually achieve anything or in a conflict between the Evil Genius and The Brute have the Evil Genius mock the Brute for using brute force to compensate for their low intelligence and explain their simplemindedness makes him predictable and as such easy to beat or the Brute pointing out how the Evil Genius relies on their minions and Humongous Mecha to fight their battles and for all their vaunted intelligence they cant make any of their big schemes stickAlternatively it could take the form of Even Evil Has Standards if the other villain did something they find completely unnecessary and appalling If two or more Professional Killers are hired to track down the heroes a Psycho for Hire can get this from a Hitman with a Heart who voices their disgust at the formers capacity for torture rape and enjoyment of destruction and killing or a Consummate Professional who loses patience with how their psychotic tendencies draw unwanted attention and their distaste for taking the simple approach makes the mission needlessly complicated If the Big Bad crosses the Moral Event Horizon the Noble Top Enforcer may drop one explaining how they were let down by their boss and feel betrayed by the one they looked up to before they quit A Defector from Decadence may give one against their entire country before they leave and if two villains team up to fight the heroes one of them may eventually break off their partnership with one of these as a way of establishing them as the Lighter Shade of Black Either way it can be a Moment of Awesome when the person on the receiving end has it comingThis form often doubles as a way to explain the reasoning behind a Villainous Rescue without Leaning on the Fourth Wall too hard    A Hero Addresses Another Hero Speeches from hero to hero usually come up whenever a heros Designated Hero status becomes irritating to the other protagonist or they feel that the hero being called out must be taken down a peg or more This is also occasionally done in Good Versus Good scenarios where a protagonists morality is being called into question by another protagonist who doesnt agree with their methods It usually takes place following a hero doing something particularly unheroic or if their general unpleasantness has gone past the point of acceptance Often doubles as What Were You Thinking and What the Hell Hero and in particularly bad circumstances it may cause allies to turn against one another    An AcquaintanceFriend Addresses Another AcquaintanceFriend This speech is given by someone whos just frustrated with the other person This is not an attempt to bring down or break an opponent This is not an exchange between heroes and villains heck they might even be friends This is someone tired of everything they have to deal with giving a frank and brutally honest assessment of the person theyre dealing with often in a What the Hell Hero moment This can be prone to backfire with a suitably shallow selfobsessed andor savvy target who typically responds with Youve just listed all of my best features Other times however the one who gave the speech overreacted and says that they are too harsh and its not really how they feel Will often provoke an attempted refutation or justification from the target which depending on the source can be played for comedy drama or Wangst If the target is a Designated Hero this occurrence just might motivate them to become a real hero    A Protagonist Calls Out Themselves Sometimes a protagonist in a particular shows is so filled with selfloathing that when prompted decide that theyre fed up with themselves and calls out the worst of villains themselves If done in a comedy or a Dramedy this is usually Played for Laughs However in other cases this is almost always done for drama This might be because the hero is suffering Heroic BSoD or might have implied or explicitly stated to suffer Depression This is the ultimate form of SelfDeprecation in a work Of course this could also be done to get people to sympathize with the protagonist    Someone Calls Out the Crowd The indulgences of the crowd disgusts the speaker to such an extent that they must speak out against it Calling everyone in attendance for their failures in life in a cruel but often necessary manner If it gets meta and is directed at the audience it also counts as You BastardOne thing all seven types of speech have in common is that the speaker has a point even if theyre villains To give a speech about it the speaker has to have thought it through and can usually have more than one reason why you suck This is because the writer of the story has also thought it through This is a sister trope to Calling the Old Man Out or Calling the Old Woman Out Compare Talking the Monster to Death where this is meant to kill or redeem a villain Could also be a Take That Scrappy where someone tells a hated character what the audience feels about them This can lead to failure if the character receiving the speech Cant Take Criticism Can also overlap with a Cowardice Callout which is when someone calls someone else out for fearbased shortcomingsCompare and contrast the No More Holding Back Speech which may incorporate elements of this See also Did You Actually Believe and Youre Nothing Without Your Phlebotinum An ArmorPiercing Response can provide a short but effective way of calling someone out Put to music this is The Diss Track and can become a The Villain Sucks Song or The Hero Sucks Song ForeignLanguage Tirade is quite fittingly a foreignlanguage variant of this tropeContrast Minor Insult Meltdown where just the tip of the you suck iceberg can sink someone to tears Contrast also You Are Better Than You Think You Are and Grade System Snark See also Compassionate Critic and Constructive CriticismLastly no this isnt the trope thats about the reasons that characters are bad at speaking Neither is it a meta Justification for This Loser Is You Finally youll find that some of these can be used to serve as Dare to Be Badass speeches too,10242
Magical Security Cam,Its very sweet until you realize how many hidden cameras he had to set up to get all this— Bill Corbett Batman  Robin RiffTraxIn many situations where someone watches a recording of an event that the audience has already seen happening the recording will — by the purest coincidence — happen to use exactly the same footage that the audience has already witnessed That is to say it will include all the same dramatic camera angles pans and zooms as the original scene despite that theres no way an inuniverse device especially a stationary device like a fixed security camera could have captured and produced such well cinematic footageEven if not recycled footage there are other elements used to produce a similar results including Perfect composition especially notable on a panning camera keeping perfect pace with the subject They are rarely standing in the upper right corner of the screen with their back turned Cinematic angles as most security cameras are stationed near the ceiling looking down not making it very effective in showing a closeup of an actor Even the footage of an InUniverse camcorder using Jitter Cam can make you wonder why the subjects arent aware they are being recorded Dynamic editing letting us jump in at the best part Especially helpful with paring down the footage from multiple cameras as even just a splitscreen means someone had to sync it up Image resolution and sound quality on par with nonsecurity cam footage Even in the modern era of 4K cameras many security cameras used today still produce lowresolution images that can even make it difficult to make out facial detail Smooth continuous video A camera that continuously records and saves high resolution high frame rate video will run out of storage space in short order Even today security cameras tend to have very low frame rates you only need a few frames per second to be able to at least tell what is going on and often only save footage when movement is detectedSometimes this is Hand Waved by overlaying visual effects on the recording — conversion to blackandwhite simulated scanning lines a datetime stamp or watermark meaningless computerese advanced technology where cameras can be anywhere and so on this still doesnt change the fact that the movie isnt attempting to recreate the scene as it would actually appear to the inuniverse device This is only averted in science fiction settings where the footage is often a holographic recording instead allowing the characters to directly observe the incidentSee also Magical Computer Caught on Tape Compare Surveillance as the Plot Demands where the footage is equally implausible but due to location How did they get a camera on the moon and not necessarily the angles For security cams that are actually magical see Magical Camera,2788
Hollywood Heart Attack,A CERTAIN ONOMATOPOEIAOooo Its the Big One You hear that Elizabeth Im comin to you Im comin home to join you honey— Fred Sanford Sanford and SonYour character is going along in their daily life when suddenly they complain of a shooting radiating pain in their left shoulder and arm Within seconds they stagger clutching at their chest while their face turns bright red then they drop like a stone to the floor unconscious and probably dead Congratulations your characters just had a Hollywood Heart AttackMay be consciously averted in modern medical dramas if the writers careReal Life heart attacks vary in their nature ranging from dying in your sleep to chestclutching dramatics to ones you dont realize youve had until an ECG years later discovers the damage left behind Some sufferers collapse some dont Some throw up some faint This is especially true for women While some women do have chest pain the more common heart attack symptoms in women are nausea dizziness heartburn and feeling faint and therefore may go unnoticed or mistaken for simple stress or indigestion because the symptoms are so vague A massive heart attack can also make blood gather in the veins of the lower intestine and weigh it down making the person feel like they have to use the bathroom When you hear of people dying on the toilet that is usually what happened this also is why hospital bathrooms have emergency pulls by the toiletsNote that some examples go so far wrong as to call a heart attack heart failure which is a completely different group of syndromesnote In addition to congestive heart failure CHF which is the most common theres also acute decompensated heart failure highoutput heart failure and a number of other subtypes that has to do with the hearts ability to efficiently pump the blood it receives,1803
Driven by Envy,Whos the greenest one of allIn the untalented excellence generates a sense of wonder and amazement In the merely talented on the other hand genius creates burning hatred and envy— Harlan Ellison from his introduction to The Sandman Season of Mists by Neil GaimanSometimes the heros many strengths and talents will inspire due awe and respect and envy No matter how amazing and lovable the protagonist is these traits will invariably manage to rub somebody the wrong way sometimes prompting people into doing horrible things just to get the hero out of their sightA subtrope of GreenEyed Monster Driven by Envy is a trope that deals specifically with a character acting on his envy It is related to Always Second Best Expect the character to think the one he envies is as preoccupied with him as the other way around and even that he deliberately excels in order to rub the envious characters nose into itFor those instances where love rather than envy is the impetus for the misdeeds see If I Cant Have You and Murder the Hypotenuse,1032
My Country Tis of Thee That I Sting,An antipatriotic joke made by people from the very country its poking fun atIf what your country is doing seems to you practically and morally wrong is dissent the highest form of patriotism— The Use of Force in International Affairs 1961 note The quote has been misattributed to Thomas Jefferson but has been used by Howard Zinn in his Dissent In Pursuit of Equality Life Liberty And Happiness An Interview With Historian Howard Zinn 2002While patriotism can be noble or nice there can be times when one is ashamed of their country Usually its politically or socially motivated Some people dislike the imperialistic militaristic chauvinistic or nationalistic approach of their own government and fellow citizens Others especially minorities have been victimized by their government or their fellow citizens and resent the majorityThese are the people who feel that My Country Right or Wrong is mostly wrong and have nothing but contempt for Misplaced Nationalism They will vocally criticize their own country and feel that they are in their right to do so since they were born there themselves Though they can sometimes be categorized as misanthropes or a Boomerang Bigot there are also enough examples of people having good reasons andor arguments to criticize their country of birth This can result into active protest marches with the intent to change things Or in a less drastic fashion result in SelfDeprecation comedy done for satirical purposesIn some countries such criticism is seen as highly unpatriotic even treasonous Dictatorships are the most obvious example but even in some democratic countries expressing such opinions can bring people into serious trouble and politicians opposing those in power will take pains to emphasize that they love their country despite their disagreements Yet in a truly free society criticism of your own country should be respected Lots of sociological revolutions and changes have occurred just because people questioned the ideas of their government and society and many modern countries trace their founding date to such uprisings celebrating them with patriotic songs and holidays People who embody this trope usually consider criticism of their homeland as an act of patriotism in itself reflecting the other part of My Country Right or Wrong if wrong to be set rightContrast with Propaganda Piece See Misplaced Nationalism for criticism of one people or country towards another Offending the Creators Own would be the religious and ethnic equivalent of this trope See also Cultural Cringe when this is done against a creators culture and BitingtheHand Humor when this is done against the productions distributor Compare Hail to the Thief when criticism is directed toward the head of state often in song,2756
Let Us Never Speak of This Again,Sometimes you dont want to know all the bare details of a storyJesse You know how you have those experiences you remember and reminisce about for the rest of your life Axel Yeah Jesse This isnt one of those Lets never discuss this ever again— Minecraft Story ModeA character must perform an act that is either against their nature or which they have vehemently and constantly protested against doing Said action can also be just plain humiliating or all of the above—to all parties perhaps When this act is aided or witnessed a character insists that either they must all never speak of this again ever or that a specific person who is guaranteed to ride them never hears of itOr to put it another way What happened here stays hereThis trope can be used to introduce a Noodle Incident with one character reminding the other they promised never to speak of that again Alternatively they may have just completed the action make some passing reference to how unusual or interesting it was and then pull this lineSubversions can occur when the characters kept in the dark reveal themselves to have known all along or if the character who would have used the incident as ammunition against all expectations chooses not to do so Sometimes that somebody will bring it up again earning the reaction I thought we agreed to never speak of it again or something close to thatIt can be parodied by the persons who are told to never mention it again being genuinely unaware of what happened for whatever reason leading them to ask something like Speak about what again which is then taken by the person wanting the secret kept as a joke implying compliance with their wishPrequels occasionally resort to this trope as a way to justify their events not being mentioned in works that were written earlier but set as a later date inVerseWill often be Played for Laughs as the thing that will never be mentioned was usually something funnyembarrassing or Played for Drama especially if the event was something that happened between two characters who may or may not end up together,2064
NighInvulnerability,The Tick Urgh Got to pull myself to gether Must defy laws of physics Arthur Fight it Tick Fight that black hole— The TickSomeone cannot be harmed Merely fighting them wont make them go away if at all possible their defeat requires one to figure out how which is a legendary quest in and of itself Usually the ability of the Big Bad in scifi and fantasy settings few heroes get this one Except in Super Hero series with Superman being the flagship exampleEither one has to find their Achilles Heel or else summon up a nuclearbombs worth of power in the last episode either through The Power of Love or Ki Manipulation or really heavy armaments eg When All You Have Is a Hammer and hope for Villain DecaySometimes a vaguely defined nighinvulnerability is a way to make a hero only as tough as he needs to be to advance the plotTheres a number of ways one can have Nigh Invulnerability Made of Diamond The power of the Implacable Man and The Juggernaut nothing does anything to this being Not a boot to the head or a bullet to the eye or a sledgehammer to the groin Sufficiently strong characters might be able to knock them through a wall or mountain but just one hit like that wont have any lasting effect This is generally what people first think of when referring to this trope Ironically the title is a bit of a misnomer While in real life diamonds have extreme hardness they lack toughness and are brittle enough to be shattered by a hammer Made of Air Going the opposite direction there doesnt seem to be something to fight but that something can fight you Either they have the power of Super Smoke or Intangibility completely at will so that you cant attack them or they may exist in some form that makes direct confrontation just not possible an Astral Projection for example or just a plain old ghost Made of Liquid AKA The Blob a common variant of this when the character is made of some sort of fluid stuff that makes him tangible but completely impervious to damage with bludgeoning or piercing weapons Made of Rubber Somewhere in between the last two where most attacks just seem to bounce off with little to no effect to the victim Kevlard Similar to made of rubber but with protective blubber instead This is the form that XMens Blob benefits from Unlike the former usually they have some sort of weak spot RegenerationRegrowth They have the truly nasty tendency to recover from anything Cut off their head and it grows back Cut them to pieces and they just reassemble themselves Burn them to ashes and mail them to Mexico Norway and Hong Kong and theyll rebuild themselves From a Single Cell Whether the character can survive being utterly atomised varies from fiction to fiction External RepairSpare Body Parts Like regenerationregrowth but external Most common with machines and cyborgs but occasionally works for the undead or supernatural and sometimes even a skilled Mad Doctor can pull this off with normal organisms Chop off an arm Meh if its too damaged to reattach no big deal its replaceable Blown into tiny chunks That might take a little longer but can sometimes still be fixed Body Backup Drive is the most extreme form of this with a character being able to transfer their consciousness into a complete replacement body This new body may be modified as necessary and possibly have some form of invulnerabilities themselves The Proxy When a person makes use of other bodies or identities in order to conceal themselves and avoid direct contact therefore reducing risk of injurydeath The proxy could take the form of a remotecontrol robot a cloned flesh puppet or a body double If the proxy is encountered often enough it can give the semblance of invulnerability Alternatively the person can be hit but the proxy somehow takes all the damage instead Multiple Bodies Similar to the above this classic power of the Hive Mind will render the death of one body irrelevant At worst to kill enemies with this ability will require killing every single part of him since even one survivor may be able to recreate a whole new army of selves However if they have a Hive Queen killing it may destroy the whole being Body Surf Similar to Multiple Bodies and Body Backup Drive above but instead they possess another living person to use for themselves possibly transforming the body of the possessed into something related to the new owner This may be even nastier than any of the above especially when it has no limitations on whom they can possess although usually destroying the body when the consciousness is still inside will kill both the possessed and the possessing entity permanently Usually Resurrection You technically can kill them but the problem is that they dont stay dead Just pray that they dont have the ability to adapt to whatever that managed to kill them before such that It Only Works Once andor unlimited amount of extra life Rebirth Related to above except when killed theyll be reborn as an infant Only applies if the character retains their memoriespersonality from their prior life and probably will want you dead for killing them the first time around No Pain While you can technically damage them their lack of pain receptors means that they will just keep coming Very much Depending on the Writer while a punch to the face will usually be ignored chopping off a limb will presumably limit anyones mobility regardless though some authors raise this ability to superhuman levels No Pain for the Undead Lack of pain is justified because the character is a member of the living dead This usually means that even severe organ damage can just be ignored though even such characters tend to have limits in how far this can be pushed Extreme Luck You dont need to be invincible when you never get hit Dumb LuckCrazy Luck The clumsy heroheroine can dodge everything just because of extreme luck Hilarity Ensues when the character is a Miles Gloriosus who believes they are Made of Diamond but are actually this or the Cloudcuckoolander leisurely strolls through Bullet Hell Impossibly Good Luck They charge headlong at a machine gun and win Often paired with The Determinator not all of the bullets miss just the lethal ones Expect an Oh Crap moment when paired with The Berserker Also the constant disappointment of a chronic Death Seeker Making Their Own Luck Some characters literally have luck on their side in the form of crunching the numbers only seeming to be relying on luck having a friendship with the one setting the odds or actually changing them themselves RealityWarping They dont want to be hurt so you cant hurt them Simple as that God Face it Sometimes you CANT kill a god Its physically and theologically impossible However other gods can sometimes kill gods so they do technically fit the nigh part Divine Protection The character itself is not a god but can survive anything due to intervention of a favorable godguardian angelspirit of parent that has been struck down and become more powerful than you can possibly imagine Can Only Kill Part of Him Fighting a Shadow Basically the whatsit that you were fighting was just its representation in the same world Killing its body in this dimensional plane is a mild setback if at all as it can grow that back very quickly or replace it Technically not that different from Resurrection from the mortals point of view but distinct in that the actual entity never died only their current physical manifestation Usually applies to gods demons and perhaps Cosmic HorrorA combination of limited supertoughness superpain tolerance and regeneration is a popular power set to render a character effectively nighinvulnerable while still being shown to suffer temporary pain and injury in a way that gives recognisable stakes to physical threats even if we know they wont be fatalThe Physical God Implacable Man The Juggernaut Blob Monster Iron Butt Monkey The Chew Toy and anything Made of Indestructium all probably have some form of Nigh InvulnerabilityCompare of course Immortality for the ways in which characters cannot die Contrast Made of Iron where no explanation is given for an individuals incredible resilience See also Immortal Life Is Cheap which applies to such cases as Multiple Bodies or Regeneration and Trainstopping which tends to have this as a requirement When someone is invulnerable to literally everything then it becomes Complete Immortality,8360
Babysitters Nightmare,Dad holding his empty wallet after paying Rosalyn Youre sure no one else in this town will agree to babysit CalvinMom Maybe you would like to spend a week on the phone— Calvin and HobbesSome children arent satisfied with just being bratty Oh no thats too simple They make it their personal mission to systematically drive away every single babysitter nanny tutor caretaker teacher mentor or other person their beleaguered parents hire to look after them One after another they leave the house some in tears never to return Eventually the kids reputation is so terrible that absolutely no one in town is willing to babysit them unless the little monsters parents are offering exorbitant amounts of money and sometimes not even thenIn stories where the babysitter is the protagonist theyre likely to be drawn to the job by the promise of said exorbitant amount of money They might balk after being told horror stories about the kid by previous babysitters but decide that putting up with the kid cant possibly be that awful—and besides they really need that money Theyre always Instantly Proven Wrong but if they can survive a night with the kid the reward will be worth itTo make things even harder Babysitters Nightmares frequently come in packs families with several children especially Trickster Twins are likely to qualify for this trope For obvious reasons multiple children are harder to take care of than a single child and one strongwilled child can easily railroad their siblings into going along with making the babysitters night a complete hellSometimes the child turns out to be misbehaving because of something else that is going on in their life such as abuse neglect bullying or their parents getting a divorce a particularly common scenario is the kid acting out because their parents never pay attention to them and leave them with babysitters all the time A caring babysitter might try to help the child with that problem which can lead to a deeper understanding between the two of themCompare Pity the Kidnapper in which kidnappers may seriously regret taking a rich mans child for ransom Exemplified in O Henrys short story The Ransom of Red Chief where two rather dim rogues found the family refused to pay to get their brat backSince Tropes Are Flexible this trope can apply to similar situations that dont necessarily involve babysitting such as a student no teacher wants to have in their classroom or a badly behaved destructive pet that no one wants to petsitThe child in question may have Pushover Parents or Abusive Parents or Neglectful Parents in the kid misbehaving because of their crappy home life version Subtrope of Bratty HalfPint and possibly Enfant Terrible Spoiled Brat Creepy Child and Lonely Rich Kid Related to Badly Battered Babysitter Babysitting Episode and Expelled from Every Other School If the babysitter actually manages to tame the tiny terror the result might be a Babysitter Friendship They might be an Annoyingly Repetitive Child,2982

Dont You Dare Pity Me,LEAVE MEEvery last one of them They have the gall to take pity on me and they dont even know how much theyre hurtin me by doin it— Nnoitra Gilga BleachAn injured or suffering character is approached by another eager to help but the injured party is offended This reaction of humiliation and resentment may be spoken acted upon or merely felt but it is some variation on I dont want your pity or Dont you dare pity me This may be used as actual Stock Phrases but the reaction does not have to be verbalizedThe more serious the problem the more likely this is to cause conflict Temporary situations can invoke it for a time as when Manly Tears or worse Sand In My Eyes causes another to try to comfort the weeping characterThis is most likely to come from a character who does not deal well with sympathy even in the best of times The Broken Bird Troubled but Cute The Tsundere the Jerk with a Heart of Gold and the Ice Queen are particularly likely to react this way Indeed it may develop that their touchy character stems from this and can be resolved if it is Someone wearing a Tough Leader Façade doubly so since anything for which they can be pitied is a weakness and danger The Stoic Woobie is often this trope embodied Getting them to fess up about it much less confront it can be a difficult prospectThere is a range of possible interactions At one extreme an injured character tries to avoid insensitive or demonstrative sympathy that rubs salt in the wound They might accuse others of having Come to Gawk They might fear that any response to their problem will break them down when they cannot afford to break down The pity may be effusive for a trivial problem or something that the character does not consider as such In other examples the character cannot tell their remorse is sincere the Handicapped Badass is managing just fine thank youAt the other extreme the sufferer rejects sorely needed and selflessly offered help and suffers all the more for it They might inflict suffering on others in the processGenuine pity is often portrayed as an affront to the dignity of the pitied as the pityer is at least implicitly signaling their advantage over and superiority to the pitied though there is also the popular Aesop that too much Pride is foolish and shallow The injured character may hide from others to preempt pity For any such character mentioning his problem may hit a Berserk Button The character can wallow in selfpity but that is differentThe effect is more dramatic if the characters knew each other before the injury or if the problem is invisible The pitying character may change after The Reveal If the other person is in any way responsible for the injury things can get very ugly indeedA hero sympathising with a villains backstory may also incite this response but be careful this trope can be done badly A character frequently angrily rejecting any form of comfort may come across as an Ungrateful Bastard or Unintentionally Unsympathetic when that may not even be the case Alternatively this can be presented as a genuine character flawCompare Think Nothing of It for when a character wants to avoid praise for admirable behavior Leave Me Alone a common phrase also said by characters of this type and Past Experience Nightmare where the character tries to hide his pain but it still comes out in his unguarded moments Also compare Declaration of Personal Independence,3401

Status Quo Is God,Looks like everythings back the way it was Which is the only way it should ever be— Marge Simpson The SimpsonsWithin a work particularly longrunning series and franchises almost nothing changes If something does change its generally reset back to the way it was before very quicklyThis usually happens in a series with no overarching conflict or plot although it is also the final stage of Exponential Plot Delay the phenomenon in which the plot of a serial story has totally ground to a halt In either case each installment of the series will open under virtually identical circumstances to the installment that came beforeWhy create a static situation The creators want the audience to be familiar with the characters and situation without having to bother with such things as what happened last episodeThis trope is especially true for cartoons where networks want to be free to broadcast reruns in any convenient order or lack thereof Its also very common in sitcoms and as a result there is a lot of Aesop Amnesia created Although characters have learned their lessons or attempted to improve their predicaments nothing ever really changesWhile this trope can be used to help avoid Continuity Lockout it also can be very difficult to juggle an unchanging status quo without gradually turning off your audience characters and situations which never change tend to get stale after a while and audiences can get a bit tired of seeing the Reset Button being pushed every time it looks like something might happen to change thingsStatus Quo Is God can easily collide with Happily Ever After Sometimes a story simply cant have an ending that is both happy and maintains the status quo—thus these two powerful tropes are in conflict with each other When this conflict occurs its likely that the status quo will be maintained and the ending will be less happy than it might have been if not for Status Quo Is God For example if a main character gains a significant other at the beginning of the episode it is almost certain that they will break up by the end for one reason or another On the other hand if the entire series is due to end and the creators feel confident that theyll never do a sequel they may decide to break this trope with a Grand Finale that permanently fixes everythingStatus Quo Is God is usually the justification for a Yo Yo Plot Point or an Ageless Birthday Episode It has nothing to do with the divinity of a certain rock band howeverNegative Continuity is what happens when this trope is exaggerated—not only does nothing ever change it doesnt even require an explanation InUniverse the world just resets at the end of every episode See also Alternate Universe Reed Richards Is Awesome in which characters get a glimpse of an alternative universe where things have in fact changedRelated to Just Eat Gilligan and UnConfession Unlikely Spare may also be used to this effect For the opposite in which a work changes dramatically over the course of its run see Nothing Is the Same Anymore,3008

Artistic License  History,King Xerxes Hair vs NairIn a real historical piece if they tried to make everything slavishly right any show would be unwatchable because there would be too much that the audience couldnt understand The audience would be constantly distracted by details like unfilmably dark building interiors ugly missing teeth infants being given brokenwinged songbirds as disposable toys to play with crush and throw away and Marie Antoinette relieving herself on the floor at Versailles  We cannot make an accurate movie of this — it will please no one— Ada Palmer on historic accuracy in fictionAh yes history written by the victors with all the eyewitnesses lost to time Some say its one of those mysteries that man cannot know That in the end all known history is subjective and therefore useless as a source of knowledgeNot so Large chunks of history are welldocumented with many living traces in contemporary life — roads paved on pathways carved by ancient civilizations languages and slang that evolve from a particular regional starting point architecture from various eras fashions plucked from various times materials used for tools and production etc but all of this is secondary to telling a good story In most cases historical works focus on a particular event taken out of context revolving around a set group of individuals and depict the events with the pictorial and narrative structure as per the fashions of the year of its exhibition Real history is filled with a vast array of characters with plenty of Hero of Another Story In addition many writers commit whats called the historians mistake which is the idea that historical characters acted and made their decisions with full knowledge of the future — including the repercussions their actions would cause like for example portraying Churchill as saying his Darkest Hour Rousing Speech with knowledge that Nazi Germany was going to be defeated in 4 yearsnote This is also known in psychology as Hindsight Bias Although some historical individuals made predictions that came true this is not the same thing as knowing what would happen For instance a character in 1919 could plausibly predict that the Treaty of Versailles would cause hardship anger and instability in Germany indeed Marshal Foch himself said at the time it was not a peace treaty just an armistice for twenty years if only because he understood it to be too lenient but it would be stretching it for him to confidently assert that the instability would specifically result in the rise of a ruthless racial supremacist paramilitary regime in Germany that would be hellbent for revenge starting the biggest war in human history and along the way responsible for the systematic murder of millions of Jews Roma and others Likewise works of art are not so cheap to create It costs something in time and money to properly research find and create the material needed to portray a given period with some degree of accuracy There are also the limits of the medium to contend with To play a famous painter believably casting another famous painter is usually not considered a smart rule for casting The best of actors will struggle to believably render genius convincingly There are limits to the illusion cast by a work of art in portraying a historical reality even in the best scenario This also applies to writers who would struggle to render the thoughts and dialogues of the distant past in a manner that is convincing to the reader that gives a believable impression of a past where society and values were different from the present but not so different as to be unrelatable In cases where the given period has very few records available most of it has to be fictionalized anyway Likewise where history does lean on records there is still room for interpretation and ambiguity so in these cases historians and artists share common groundIn most cases however historians and artists dont really have the same job A historians job is to relate the facts and update them as new information comes to light An artists job is to reflect on history showing why certain individuals and events were important and remain important decades and centuries later Even when history is Written by the Winners and censorship dominates cultures as it did for a long time in human history artists tend to be drawn to particular events and figures more than others Whether its the Folk Hero the Founder of the Kingdom the iconic Rebel Leader certain people and events are interesting because they are more relatable to people than others This often leads to a sense of distortion where thanks to constant references in history the impact of some historical figures looms larger than the facts would allow and in some cases greatly exaggerates the given person or events relative importanceStill while artists and historians have parallel jobs in cases where the former doesnt keep up to pace with new research you can see the persistence of discredited information decades and even centuries after being academically debunked See Dated History for those rare cases where new evidence or insight actually does change the historical record Compare Anachronism Stew where the inaccuracies are not fictional inventions just details drawn from different eras Hollywood History where the facts are mostly right just caricatured and stereotyped subject to Bowdlerization and Nostalgia Filter and Future Imperfect where characters in a speculative fiction story set in the distant future get history horribly wrong The Historical Hero Upgrade and Historical Villain Upgrade sometimes fall into this An Orphaned Etymology may occur when a word or name is used in a work regardless of whether the historical circumstances that brought the term into use had actually happened yet in the works universeThis trope is NOT for speculative history stories which get a pass simply because theyre supposed to be alternate history stories unless they reference these events as parts of actual history,5989

Pilot                    aka The Pilot,Well the way they pick TV shows is they make one show That shows called a pilot Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows and on the strength of that one show they decide if they want to make more shows Some get chosen and become television programs Some dont become nothing— Jules Pulp FictionA pilot is a test run of a series concept filmed and assembled to give the network an idea of what it will look like how it will play and via viewer testing what kind of demographic it will appeal to On American TV only about a quarter of pilots are turned into a series Some insiders have snidely claimed that Hollywood is more about making pilots than actually making shows Sometimes a network will throw it back to the producers and say try againThe term pilot is used in this sense outside the entertainment industry a pilot plant for example may be a smallerscale power plant thats used to test some new generation technologyEven when a show is picked up and given a timeslot there is no guarantee that a pilot will ever reach the air Granted they usually do air and as the premiere episode for obvious reasons But sometimes usually with those shows whose producers were told try again the original pilot is so different from what reached the air that they dont try to use it as is the case with Gilligans Island or they recycle the plot in an innovative manner later in the series Good examples of the latter would be The Cage the first pilot episode of Star Trek The Original Series which was recycled into the twopart episode The Menagerie plus the Peppa Pig pilot which was recycled into multiple episodesLiveaction pilots often have somewhat larger budgets than a typical episode of the series but fewer purposebuilt sets A hospital or school or graveyard in a pilot is likely to be the real thing  no sense building an elaborate set for a pilot that probably wont be picked up As such if the series is picked up and purposebuilt sets are built to replace these locations then eagleeyed viewers might be able to spot differences between the characters base of operations from the first week to the secondThe writing in a pilot can be significantly worse than in regular episodes Introducing all the characters and setting up the situation in a limited time can be difficult to do in a natural way and even the best pilots can be prone to clunky exposition In addition pilots often are slightly differentlyshaped than the series that coalesce if the show gets picked up for example in the pilot of Gilmore Girls Sookie is a Cute Clumsy Girl this trait fades away by the fourth or so episode Lorelai drives a different car and many of the sets are not the ones used later in the show as a real street in Toronto was used rather than the Main Street set at Warner Bros Studios which was used as Stars Hollow for the rest of the series Pilots may also be filmed on a different stock than the rest of the series the pilot may look more cinematic in film story and cinematography than other episodes in the series If its the length of a film and presented as such then its a Pilot Movie The same rules roughly apply to animation except that a pilot in that industry usually never exceeds eleven minutes unless it is the aforementioned pilot movieShould a pilot be integrated into another series its a PoorlyDisguised PilotMost pilots fall into the category of the Welcome Episode or Everyone Meets Everyone Itd make more sense to list the exceptions than the examples They may also contain a FirstEpisode Twist See Failed Pilot Episode for an index of pilots that have pages but not full showsMany many pilot episodes are simply named Pilot making Pilot the most common episode title among all series,3714

Funny Foreigner, Great SuccessHey everybody I am from Holland Isnt that vwierd— Goldmember Austin Powers In GoldmemberForeigners are funny Or so say a good number of comedy shows The jokes practically write themselves foreigners mangle the language especially idioms in funny ways they are ignorant of customs in the shows home country and they have their own bizarre little customs that make no sense They will either be unsure of themselves or more frequently totally oblivious to how odd everybody finds them This is incredibly old probably dating back to when cavemen joked about people in the cave down the fieldThe Funny Foreigner is a Cyclic Trope In the 19th and early 20th Centuries it seems like at least half of all the Western comedy in existence consisted of this trope Vaudeville British musichall performers Gradually from the 1960s on it become a Discredited Trope due to changing sensibilities Then it became so rare that it seemed daring and forbidden and thus became popular again This can lead to the trope being discredited for some generations and not for othersOld Funny Foreigner jokes tended to be stereotypes about a particular country Modern ones do it with a wink by just making up a Fictional Country choosing a real country almost at random and ignoring any actual facts about it or simply leaving it entirely ambiguous where theyre meant to be from Part of the joke is that it doesnt really matter where in the Middle East or Latin America or Eastern Europe the character comes from  theyre just generic Latin or generic Slav They can even go so far as to have the character not actually be foreign at all or playing up their ethnicity because they can get away with itIn Speculative Fiction they might be visitors from a completely different world which has the advantage of avoiding Unfortunate Implications and offense to realworld foreigners most of the time If the character is an otherworldly being relative to the rest of the cast then the trope is Amusing AlienIf done poorly a Funny Foreigner can turn into an Ethnic Scrappy in which case you can also get Mexicans Love Speedy GonzalesCompare and contrast with But Not Too Foreign Fauxreigner Fun with Foreign Languages No Social Skills Raised by Natives Unintelligible Accent and Foreign Wrestling Heel Also see Crazy Cultural Comparison which is when the Funny Foreigners behavior is held against that of his host See also Idiosyncratic Cultural Gesture,2430
Skewed Priorities,Bro its a DS Cant you just close itWe could all have been killed — or worse expelled— Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Philosophers StoneCommon sense tells us that tasks and goals which have severe consequences if they are ignored—such as avoiding death obtaining food and shelter taking care of your spouse and children or not getting fired from your job—are more important than optional desires such as looking fashionable not missing your favorite television program obtaining some rare collectible or saving a trivial amount of money If theres some kind of emergency youre supposed to drop everything and deal with it because nothing else is that important Except there are certain people who seem to have it all backwards ignoring serious problems while spending their effort on things that are relatively meaningless They might risk their lives by running back into a burning building to save some easily replaceable possession spend the money that they need for dialysis treatments on a flatscreen TV or drive a hundred miles out of their way to fill up at a station where fuel is only ten cents cheaper Usually this is to underscore how obsessed they are with a particular object or subject and it tends to be Played for Laughs as long as their foolishness only backfires on them Its more difficult to laugh about when the characters skewed priorities cause permanent injury to another innocent personCan result in Disproportionate Retribution And Then What or Im Thinking It Over Compare with Arson Murder and Jaywalking See also Honor Before Reason Always Save the Girl and I Broke a Nail Major Injury Underreaction and Comically Missing the Point could overlap with this same can be said for Dramatically Missing the Point and Minor Injury Overreaction Compare Bystander Syndrome where everyone has Skewed Priorities Compare This Is No Time for Knitting where someones apparent Skewed Priorities turn out to be on the right track after all as well as Worrying for the Wrong Reason where one character expresses some concern about a situation and another corrects them with a new concern Advertising likes this trope poking fun at the idea that their product is so awesome you should abandon everything else in favor of it For when a character thinks social media is more important than safety see Social Media Before Reason The Indy Hat Roll is a highspeed example if the item reached back for isnt actually vital When the police do this its The Lopsided Arm of the LawThis trope is a favourite of the Cloudcuckoolander though anyone can be prone to it See also Worst News Judgment Ever for when it applies to the mediaObviously Truth in Television though due to how often it can happen No Real Life Examples Please,2733
Would Hurt a Child,Cursed children of a hateful mothermay you die with your father and his houseI dont give a shit HOW old you are Maybe think before you pick a fight next time— Sol Badguy to an unconscious May Guilty Gear XrdIn fiction and in the media both heroes and villains often agree on one thing they Wouldnt Hurt a ChildThis creed exists for various reasons it may be because Children Are Innocent and thus should be protected and kept out of harms way at all costs it may be because to Moral Guardians seeing a child being brutalized is Harmful to Minors and thus should be avoided it may also be because even writers mostly disagree with the idea of writing about harming a childBut sometimes some people just dont agree with that Or just dont care And they do hurt children sometimes even kill them in defiance of the Improbable Infant Survival Indeed the act of harming a child usually comes off as the ultimate act of villainyThis trope is almost always a Kick the Dog moment Hence the presence of Would Hurt A Child is often telltale of a Crapsack World or at least a Darker and Edgier series However it is surprisingly easy to subvert this trope simply by using Kids Are Cruel the flip side of Children Are Innocent and combining it with Pay Evil unto Evil Does a soldier shooting a child soldier still seem like an ultimate villainAnd want to go all the way Make the children creepy or even better make them Enfant Terribles and this time hurting said children will look much less as a Moral Event Horizon crossing even though there will always be some Moral Guardians or Papa Wolf  Mama Bear to complain This may also be done by a Complete Monster to establish that even a villain has lines they wont dare cross Naturally the Friend to All Children sees this type of character as a mortal enemy with an exception sometimes for religious figures in some casesIn Western works this trope is rare and almost always done offpanel when played straight read when the violence towards the child isnt being stopped in the nick of time and causes actual damage largely due to broadcast standards its a little more common in literature but still not very much so In Japanese fiction child brutality can be more common but is often framed in a very specific way again to conform to their SP and has actually faded somewhat in the new millenium over content concernsImportant Note This trope is about adults physically hurting children or deliberately placing them in lifethreatening situations fatally or not The following are not examples psychologicalverbal abuse very common but not that trope abduction only applies if the child dies or gets effectively hurt depriving a child of food thats Denied Food as Punishment and only counts as this trope if taken to the point where the child is at risk of serious harm from lack of food child on child violence unless adults are forcing the children to hurt each other thats Kids Are Cruel exploitation for profit by the parents if they arent hurt that is Financial Abuse Violence to teenagers with the exception of some of those in their early teens isnt an example either since teenagers are physically stronger than children and lack the completely defenseless element especially if Teens Are Monsters However teenagers harming children appliesThere is also an interesting Double Standard when it comes to characters applying for this trope since they are almost Always Male Rarely are women described as being physically violent to children Even rarer are the instances when they actually kill them Indeed killing children is among the few things that permanently prevent a woman from a convenient HighHeelFace Turn Extra points if the killing is done directly and at the womans hands ie stabbing strangling etc Compare Pædo Hunt another child abuse trope where female perpetrators are similarly unheard ofA SubTrope of Kick the Dog Burn the Orphanage is a particular form of this See also Child Hater who hates kids but isnt necessarily physically abusive and Nice Job Breaking It Herod which is often an extreme version If theyre not stopped in time by the heroes this overlaps with Death of a Child Contrast Improbable Infant Survival and Wouldnt Hurt a Child Compare Kids Are Cruel Children Are Innocent Related to Eats Babies and Child Eater Usually applies to the Sadist Teacher If a villain who is quite capable of bothering adults prefers to spend his time as an antagonist for kids or teenagers its fair to say Pick on Someone Your Own Size For the rolereversed example of this trope see Double Standard Violence Child on Adult in which case its a child physically harming an adult for comedic effectCompare and contrast Dont Make Me Take My Belt Off which deals more with physical discipline from a parent to a child the big difference being that Would Hurt A Child always implies deliberate malevolence and cruelty towards the child whereas Dont Make Me Take My Belt Off does not unless explained otherwise by the story,4971

The Gambling Addict,A gamblers heaven and a gamblers hell Image by Thomas RowlandsonAh my bread and butter thrillseeking rich folk with a poor grasp of statistics and probability— Manny Calavera Grim FandangoA character who likes a flutter and whether its on horse races poker or lottery they do it to the extent where it becomes a bad habit or starts to cause problems They spend the familys rent money lose their job or end up owing a lot of money to The SyndicateAt the less extreme end the character will stick to small bets and simply enjoys the game In some cases they may even be able to make a profit from their gambling At the more extreme end the character is fully addicted and quite capable of ruining their own finances lives and those of the people around them Perhaps more common in older works and literature when people had to make their own entertainment and card games were a much more common social activitySometimes a character develops this trait temporarily usually in a sitcom In these cases their new habit will often lead to a big loss and the rest of the episode will be spent trying to recover the money or property Its also a very convenient habit for a writer to use as a Compressed Vice because as an emotional addiction it doesnt carry outward signs that would have to be written in or accounted for later and as a legal or quasilegal addiction can be fully depicted in even some Family Friendly works and more realistic as an addiction for some characters than say heroin Unfortunately this often leads viewers to believe it is a Compressed Vice in real life  when real life gambling addicts range the spectrum from Compressed Vicetemporary irresponsibility to those who literally cannot stop and do incur problems with the criminal justice system or are even Driven to SuicideThe difference between the Professional Gambler and the Gambling Addict is that the Professional Gambler is actually more of a combination of risky investor actor and mathematicianlogician whereas Gambling Addicts often dont know or care about the odds or strategies to play them for the best possible outcome nor do they Know When to Fold Em In fact the Gambling Addict often picks games that cant be influenced by acting or by analytical skill such as roulette slots video poker keno or lotteries They may think they have a system though Rather than for any calculable gain they play for the thrill and the prospect of the win that will come any day but likely never does or does but they lose it again if they try to stop they will find they cannot because they are hooked on this feelingNot to be confused with The Gambler Often leads to being Trapped by Gambling Debts Gambling Addiction may lead to an Absurdly HighStakes Game More likely than most to start a Gambling Brawl when experiencing a losing streak If a story arc focuses on a character becoming this its an example of Descent into Addiction A common reason for why Gambling Ruins Lives,2942

InUniverse,In their original form tropes are storytelling devices meant to convey a concept to an audience The overwhelming majority of tropes on this site are specifically that devices that can be recreated by an aspiring author who visits this wiki Other tropes are about identifying how the audience reacts to an event and are often an unintended sideeffect of the use of a trope If common enough there are separate tropes for the same thing from two points of view Some tropes tend to blur that line where both the characters within the story and the audience react the same way to the use of the trope which sometimes involves a Lampshade HangingIn this wiki you will find the use of the comment inuniverse by someone saying This trope was used inuniverse when and that is where a trope more often thought of as an audience reaction is used within the story ie its fictional universe One such use is the Invoked Trope where the characters actively set up the trope in advance though that happens more often with storytelling tropesFor an example Replacement Scrappy is a fan reaction to a replacement character The reaction is often Youre mostly the same as the previous character but youre not the one I remember and love The series Star Wars The Clone Wars has an episode where R2D2 is lost in battle and Anakin is given a new virtually identical droid He ends up having the same reaction and attitude as most fans have with a replacement characterAnd there is also a distinction between what is used in the story and the reasons it was used in the story called Watsonian versus Doylist For example Elliot was transformed with long hair during Graces birthday party in El Goonish Shive The inuniverse reason was to get Justin who likes playing with hair to agree to come The practical storytelling reason was because he would look just like Ellen otherwiseWord of advice to prospective writers Despite what may be often believed even without a lampshade writers should be aware of the tropes they are using and how people will react to it What separates Good Writing and Bad Writing is how much effort there is put into cleaning up the way tropes are used Do not neglect the Inuniverse reasons Give them a Hand Wave at least Your readers will not forgive you if you dontIts also known under a variety of other names such as InStory InSeries and InFictionAnd here are some

Visual Pun,We were told to comb the desert so were combing itDont worry bro none of this is canon But this is pulls out an actual cannon— Uncle Grandpa Steven Universe Say UncleWhen a phrase which is usually used as a metaphor is shown literally This can be because The Ditz didnt understand the statement or can just be a simple gag This kind of humor is considered dated and a bit old fashioned so most audience wont do more than smirk — at least when adults are involved children tend to be more easily amused Occasionally this action can be performed literally without the verbal set up It is a frequent pitfall when dealing with a Literal GenieCommon versions include requests to give me a hand being met with disembodied hands and quotes of Marc Antony lend me your ears — well use your imaginationThese can be quite a nightmare for translators purely textual puns can be rewritten into something else but when the pun has a visual component which usually cannot be changed it becomes much harder to come up with something that makes senseBRoll Rebus is when news and documentaries do this with Stock Footage Compare Stealth Pun which is sort of like a Visual Pun without the visuals of course sometimes a Visual Pun can be a stealth pun but you know theyre stealthy about it A SuperTrope to Metaphoric Metamorphosis where road signs are literal not figurative depictions of whats up ahead and Rules of the Road same Often a Sister Trope of Literal Metaphor,1452
Big Bad,Everything that has transpired in this trope has done so according to my designIve learned that in every story there is a big bad something An evil force that no matter the size corrupts the world of the story and tries its best to destroy the hero— LullabyThe cause of all bad happenings in a story A Big Bad could be a character with Evil Plans or it could be an omnipresent situation such as a comet heading towards the Earth In a serial story the Big Bad exerts an effect across a number of episodes even an entire season Known as the Shadow in The Heros JourneyThis trope is not a catchall term for the biggest ugliest villain of any given story In fact it doesnt have to be a villain at all as we just said If it is a villain though it should be identified correctly the badass leader of the outlaw gang that causes the most personal trouble is not the Big Bad The railroad tycoon who is using the gang as muscle is the Big Bad The Man Behind the Man is very common for this trope leaving the reveal of the big bad as The Chessmaster behind it all and proving themselves far more clever and resourceful than the Villain of the Week Sometimes the Big Bad is the grand enemy of an entire franchise At other times the Big Bad is an Arc Villain who causes trouble for a period of time only to be replaced by another Big BadIn its most general form a Big Bad will be at the center of the Myth Arc rather than just any Story Arc but this doesnt always have to be the case when you look at a seasonlong story or a major Story Arc and you can identify one problem being the cause of everything that is the Big BadThe term Big Bad was popularized in Buffy the Vampire Slayer It was characteristic of Buffys seasonal Big Bads for their identity or nature or even the fact that they were the Big Bad at all to remain unclear for a considerable time Occasionally characters would even refer to themselves as the Big Bad — whether they were a true Big Bad or just a Big Bad Wannabe is another matter The structure of Buffy placed the Big Bad as being crucial to the HalfArc Season half the episodes are filler dealing with unrelated enemies while the other half involved the ongoing Myth Arc with the Big Bad Each season can easily be defined by who the Big Bad wasIf a show has a series of Big Bad jeopardies they can function like a series of Monsters of the Week that take more than one week to finish off If there is a Legion of Doom you can expect the Big Bad to be involved somehow Theyre probably sorted by power with the strongest for last following the Sorting Algorithm of EvilIn tabletop gaming circles the Big Bad is often referred to as the BBEG Big Bad Evil GuyEvil Overlord Diabolical Mastermind The Chessmaster ArchEnemy The Man Behind the Man and often Manipulative Bastard are specific types of villains who are liable to show up as Big Bads If theyre a Magnificent Bastard or Hero Killer the good guys are in big trouble The heroic counterpart of this character is the Big Good who will very often be the focus of this characters attention over The Hero at the beginning of a series If a work of fiction is conspicuously lacking a Big Bad it may be a case of No AntagonistSee also Big Bad Duumvirate for two or more Big Bads working together Sometimes a Big Bad will get their start as a servant to another villain — if thats the case theyre a Dragon Ascendant If the character who fills the role of Big Bad in most meaningful ways is nominally subordinate to someone else someone significantly less menacing by comparison they are a DragoninChief If the story has many Big Bads at once who dont work together see Big Bad Ensemble The Big Bad Shuffle occurs when there are multiple candidates for the Big Bad position If the Big Bad doesnt start out as bad but develops over the course of the story its Big Bad Slippage If the Big Bad of one section of a work doesnt die on being defeated and stays around as a character in a different plot role reformed or not thats ExBig BadThe Big Bad of a story is not always the most powerful or oldest existing evil force Perhaps an evil presence along the lines of an Eldritch Abomination overshadows the works setting but is mainly divorced from the storys events — that would be the GreaterScope Villain,4258
FiveFinger Discount,In this life one thing counts In the bank large amounts Im afraid these dont grow on trees Youve got to pick a pocket or two— Fagin OliverThe preferred method a Street Urchin uses to acquire stuff — since theyre too poor to afford it legitimately — is to sneak it out of their marks pocket andor into their own A Rebellious Princess sometimes does this for the sheer thrill of it or because they honestly believe they dont have to pay for anything expect some kind of Freudian Excuse to come into play The Kleptomaniac Hero also does this to anything that isnt nailed down andor can be sold for money Someone with Sticky Fingers does it merely because they want or are compelled toWhen this is done to a retail establishment this is known as shoplifting The distinction between shoplifting burglary and robbery is that a shoplifter enters the store when its open and sneakily conceals an item on their person a burglar breaks into a closed store to steal items and a robber goes into the store and steals with violence or threats In Real Life shoplifters range from impoverished people who steal food to eat to middleclass Suburbia teens doing it as a prank to career criminals who do it methodically using accomplices to distract staff and aids like baggy clothesBallistic Discount is a subtrope that adds murder to the ensemble and will likely get you killed if you should ever try it in a real gun shop Percussive Pickpocket is a method of invoking this trope where the theft is disguised as a harmless bump on the street,1524
Your Television Hates You,I love having a dog and losing Blackie made me really depressed Plus having the Lassie Rin Tin Tin Sounder Turner and Hooch marathon on TV didnt help— Everybody Hates Chris Everybody Hates BlackieBob is feeling pretty bad Maybe hes feeling insecure about something Maybe he just got dumped Maybe he just had a really bad day Lets go ahead and say he got dumped So Bob decides that he just needs a break from it all and to get his mind off his problems The best way to do that of course is by sitting on his couch and watching some TVThe problem is as soon as he turns on the TV a soap opera turns on where a girl is breaking up with a guy Of course this is the last thing Bob needs to get his mind off his breakup So he changes the station only to see a standup comedian talking about the first time he got dumped So he changes the channel again and the first thing he hears is a commercial say Having relationship problems No matter how many times Bob flips the channel somebody is talking about relationships and breakups Eventually Bob gives up and turns the TV off at which point the scene usually endsThis is a quick gag thats pretty common when youre trying to make the audience feel sorry for your character or prove just how much the universe hates him Its almost always never mentioned again Can be justified when the characters circumstances are due to some supernatural agency that is also perfectly capable of controlling the programming on the TVA variant is growing where certain things individuals are trying to keep under wraps are revealed by a website advertisement since these days they are picked by checking the users browser historyCompare Coincidental Broadcast and LaserGuided Broadcast where this phenomenon is used as a plot device instead of a gag May coincide with Cold Turkeys Are Everywhere if the thing that keeps popping up on TV or radio is something that the character is trying to quit or The World Mocks Your Loss if theyre upset about losing something or someone See also Mocking Music for the radio version and Vengeful Vending Machine Only marginally related to My Car Hates Me because both are tech devices that make their owners life worse,2180
Karma Houdini,So is Satan just generous when people dont have a soul to sell Maybe if you do enough deeds in his nameIts hard to be religious when certain people are never incinerated by bolts of lightning— Calvin about Moe Calvin and HobbesSometimes even LaserGuided Karma misses its targetThe character has done a number of things that deserve a karmic comeuppance most importantly things that caused harm to the innocent But when the time comes for the hammer to fall thats not what happens At least not on them They dont get what they deserve Instead they get away scotfree They are Easily Forgiven maybe even praised and even elected president And they might even have reversed the Humiliation Conga that was being planned for them Worst comes to worst The Bad Guy Wins and a stolen happy ending takes place at the expense of the hapless victim who may be punished in the guilty characters placeThis is it This is all there is to the story The show is over The book is finished The author isnt going to write any more The Word of God has been spoken Karma is out to lunch The villain has become a Karma HoudiniPredictably it is often shocking or downright upsetting to see such scoundrels dodge instant karmic punishment and come out triumphant in the end But as frustrating as it is it does not necessarily make the story worse as long as it doesnt feel forced contrived or even shortsighted Regardless this trope runs the high risk of leaving the audiences thirst for emotional catharsis unsatiated especially when theyve become so invested in seeing the villain theyve projected their hate onto get their full commupance that may or may not come by the end And when it doesnt you can expect them to complain about it and clamor for a sequel where the villain does get their comeuppance — or alternatively theyll try to satisfy their frustratingly unfulfilled desire for retribution by writing their ownThere can be a number of reasons for this trope Sometimes the story is going for a Downer Ending in which the villains escape justice for their crimes Other times the creators overlook relatively minor offenders whether due to not considering their actions worthy of punishment or not having the time to see them get their comeuppance within the story Still other times it may not be possible to exact retribution on the characters who ends up becoming Karma Houdinis It could be that theyre too powerful to be subject to retribution any Eldritch Abomination in a horror story is likely to be this as even if they dont outright win they are so beyond mortal comprehension that the best the protagonists can hope for is to simply escape them Or it could be that theres no way to legally judge them because they are above the law in some way and the protagonists are not willing to risk it all for some vigilante justiceCompare ButtMonkey for which a character ends up having many disproportionately bad things happen to them throughout the story and may also technically qualify for this trope as hard as that sounds The extreme counterpart of the former trope Cosmic Plaything can be considered this tropes polar opposite Also compare with No Good Deed Goes Unpunished where the good guy suffers as a result of doing the right thingContrast the aforementioned LaserGuided Karma when the villains comeuppance hits at an incredibly opportune moment and is directly traceable to their transgression Karma Houdini Warranty when the comeuppance only happens in a sequel and Karmic Death when the comeuppance leads to the villains death Also see Idiot Houdini when a person is forever protected from the results of their stupidityNote that a character doesnt necessarily need to be a fulltime villain to qualify for this trope They may simply end up doing unnecessarily hurtful things yet not suffer the repercussions In contrast when someone is too evil to kill off but may suffer other consequences see Joker ImmunityNote also The work usually must be completed for a character to qualify as this trope Only if there are no more opportunities for LaserGuided Karma to strike can a character be said to have successfully avoided any consequences for their actions Exceptions may be made in cases where Status Quo Is Godnote which is why you should not add this trope to the This Image Is Not an Example index or when a character can be said to have permanently escaped eg they died peacefully in their sleep at an old age And sometimes even thats not enough Unless they somehow managed to get into Heaven and are gleefully rubbing their current state in your face Otherwise resist the urge to put it on an ongoing works pageDont mistake a lack of direct karma for this trope If a character for example murders someone and never gets caught but a freak lightning strike kills them theyve still gotten their comeuppance even though the lightning had no connection to their crime Think of the writer as God with the power to punish or not punish a character who does evilNot to be confused with a literal Houdinistyle escape by the villain to avoid justice thats Villain Exit Stage Left although the two certainly can and often do overlapThis is a

Foreign Exchange Student,Imports are nice— Monique Kim PossibleIs your work set in a school or at least has some scenes there Do you want to introduce a new character to your steadily expanding cast but the New Transfer Student isnt exotic enoughDont get your panties in a knot thats what the Foreign Exchange Student is forThe Foreign Exchange Student officially there to experience the settings culture will often be beautiful often subject to their home countrys Phenotype Stereotype and mysterious due to their foreign background Their home country varies according to the story settings and origins but its often from the United States if the setting is Eastern or Asian countries if the setting is Western Exchange students from Europe also pop up every once in a while mainly from countries like the UK Germany France Italy and even RussiaCommon plots will be the existing characters having quite a culture shock upon the foreign exchange students arrival due to preconceived assumptions about what the exchange student would be like and viceversa or finding the exchange student interesting and exotic which might rocket them to the top of the Popularity Food Chain The exchange student will also have trouble with the languagecustoms of the area and how they fit into the existing True Companions dynamicPersonalities vary in fiction but making the exchange student a Shrinking Violet a Nice Guy or a Defrosting Ice Queen seems fairly common the last one especially Moral alignment also differs as their air of mystery can mean either shyness or pure evil but theyre generally nice kidsUnlike the typical New Transfer Student the Foreign Exchange Student is rarely the main character but if they are expect them to be a Naïve Newcomer They will commonly be the Love Interest of at least one character which might cause complications when they have to leave Unless of course theyre around to cause troubleSubtrope of New Transfer Student May overlap with Funny Foreigner or Foreign People Are Sexy depending on how this trope is played If the exchange student is European Europeans Are Kinky is often used especially if shes female In this case their comparative sexual liberation will be Played for Laughs with everyone else feeling uncomfortable Contrast Stranger in a Strange School where the new kid is the only normal student,2313
Toilet Seat Divorce,A Roman divorced from his wife being highly blamed by his friends who demanded Was she not chaste Was she not fair Was she not fruitful He held out his shoe and asked them whether it was not new and well made Yet added he none of you can tell where it pinches me— Plutarch in the first century AD making this Older Than FeudalismSituation where a marriage is threatened to be broken up over a suspiciously minor setback or argument sometimes venting complaints about behavior which just surfaced This can occur even after the spouses have jumped numerous hurdles in the relationship to be together and usually smells of the inability of writers to do other plots or as cheap extension From more capable writers its more of a Rage Breaking Point the proverbial straw that broke the camels back and unloaded years worth of pentup frustration Of course it can also be Played for Laughs if the slight is ridiculously minorThe archetypical example which gives this trope its name is the cliched argument over leaving the toilet seat up or downSlightly more tolerated for teenagers who break up since you expect them to be overdramaticIn Real Life before the advent of nofault divorce laws it wasnt unknown for a couple who mutually wanted to separate to use these sorts of things so that one or both could claim mental suffering in order to have the legal justification for the divorce,1380
Unwitting Instigator of Doom,In a situation thats already a powderkeg one doesnt ignore the man handing out matchbooks— Florence Ambrose FreefallSomeone unintentionally plays a small andor unlikely but crucial role in some horrible development usually this action serves as the catalystAn Unwitting Instigator of Doom can be basically complicit with the villain but in that case theyre generally seeing only a small portion of the picture If theyre being specifically manipulated but do not realize theyre an Unwitting Pawn Other times theyre simply blundering in like a wrench in some particularly highly valued machine so it can be caused by The Load or The Millstone They may also end up as the Idiot Houdini In the worst cases more in the know characters will chew them out for bumbling in and screwing things up trusting them little better than they would a traitorCompare Nice Job Breaking It Hero for when the heroes cause doom and Mike Nelson Destroyer of Worlds for a different type of unwilling doom bringer Also compare Chekhovs Gunman in which a seemingly insignificant character becomes more important later on See also Interrupted Cooldown Hug Endangering News Broadcast Tragic Mistake and Small Role Big ImpactNo Real Life Examples Please Aside from being prone to misuse it is likely to invite Flame Wars,1291
Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness,Caption—Space to add clarification to the purpose of the image or add a metagag relevant to the tropes definitionElizabeth Swann Captain Barbossa I am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal Captain Barbossa There are a lot of long words in there Miss were naught but humble pirates What is it that you want Elizabeth I want you to leave and never come back Barbossa Im disinclined to acquiesce to your request Elizabeth stares at him in shock Barbossa Means no— Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black PearlSesquipedalian A long word or characterized by the use of long words From the Latin roots meaning a footandahalf longLoquaciousness That would be garrulousness verboseness effusiveness How about chattiness A predilection by the intelligentsia to engage in the manifestation of prolix exposition through a buzzword disposition form of communication notwithstanding the availability of more comprehensible punctiliously applicable diminutive alternatives Also known as gross verbosity Related to this is the use of inkhorn terms loanwords from a foreign origin that are pretentious to an average speakerIn brief smart characters using long words when short ones would be better especially when they are also motor mouths Characters afflicted with this trait often seem to go out of their way to overcomplicate their speech probably because writers think that this is the only way to show that someone is more intelligent than the average writer This could also be the trait of a particularly analretentive character who always has to be right the trait extending so far that the character always has to use exactly the right word — never using blue when azure or indigo or even royal blue would be more accurate for exampleOccasionally such characters may drop the long words if things get particularly dire to emphasize just how bad things are in the same way as a Sarcasm Failure Alternatively they may get even more wordy as they get more emotional leading to increasingly detailed but ultimately incoherent ranting that falls too easily into wangst Frequently another character will respond with something like Wouldnt it be easier to just whatever the brainy person said in laymans terms or And laymans terms version too In The United States when someone really has no idea what the person says theyll say something like Could you repeat that in plain ol Galveston EnglishWilliams Syndrome can lead to this kind of behavior People with Asperger Syndrome and some forms of Dyslexia may do this in an attempt to be as precise as possible ironically making themselves harder to understandThe Narcissist The Paranoiac and other lessthanpleasant personalities may engage in this as well often to try and convince others—or themselves—that they are smarter than most people On a more sinister level it can also be used as a form of verbal Gaslighting in order to confuse swamp and manipulate the receiver so that a particular end may be met The Con Man sometimes makes use of this trope too when passing off as a professional or an expert in their apparent field duping others into thinking that the only reason they dont understand what they are selling is that they are smarter than them or that they can trust them when in fact they are spouting nonsense and looking to take advantage of their ignoranceWhile maintaining a strong endeavor to avoid flogging a deceased equine err I mean trying hard not to beat a dead horse in some cases technical jargon is necessary to be understood but in too many cases a

Intelligence Equals Isolation,Being the smartest kid in class is like being the only kid in class— Dr Spencer Reid Criminal Minds Elephants MemoryThis trope is about characters or people mostly but not necessarily in college who are very smart and suffer for it being unable to relate to the mundane worries and shallow personalities of their comrades as well as being bored out of their skulls by the mandatory classes Nothing is as depressing as having to correct the teacher except not doing so for fear of the teacher getting mad Sometimes they use Obfuscating Stupidity but if their parents demand grades and they get them their classmates can get jealous which can lead to bullying of various sorts Too often Truth in TelevisionDepending on which neuroscientific theory one subscribes to the trope name is quite literal Those with more intelligence have a higher rate of disorders of some kind that can factor heavily in inducing social isolation such as autism This is especially true if they attend a school with separate programs regardless of what specific disorders theyre diagnosed with taking tests separately from other students along with extended time While beneficial that also institutionally enforces this tropeWhen this intelligence is combined with a talent for manipulation and possibly some good looks you get an explosive mixture add some Applied Phlebotinum or an Artifact of Doom and you might get a Magnificent Bastard with the potential to be a very interesting antagonist If in addition to that they are benevolent and feel compelled by their intelligence to improve the world you might get a very effective WellIntentioned Extremist who thinks Utopia Justifies the Means and who might become a Knight Templar If instead they are a Straw Nihilist beware high intelligence leads to questioning and in Morals when you find out there arent any readily made answers you might settle for there arent any answers at all so just do what you want With enough Motive Decay can become an Omnicidal Maniac and a Woobie Destroyer of WorldsNote that this is not just about popularity with others although thats certainly part of it There are examples of smart people who are popular with others but still feel that their intelligence isolates them Its pretty difficult to find common ground when explaining your thoughts bores or bewilders others after all Of course if the intelligent one is an Insufferable Genius then lack of intersocial skills or tendencies to assume superiority probably play a much bigger part in their isolation than merely being smart or mental issues feigned or otherwiseThis may be portrayed as An Aesop either showing that this isnt something you would want to strive to become or that the person who is always on their own isnt quite the freak everyone thinks they areA form of Blessed with Suck Compare Eating Lunch Alone and Broken Ace A counterpart trope is Popular Is Dumb May or may not include elements of Loners Are Freaks Often used as a justification for why Dumb Is Good dumb people may be made fun of but they wont be hassled and harassed for it Contrast Gentleman and a Scholar when a smart guy is wellliked and lacks none of the social graces,3170
It Amused Me,Cant argue with that logicRaven Great Bird Spirit Why Why did you lead us into this death trap Bird Spirit No particular reason I thought itd be funny— Jack of FablesIts Exactly What It Says on the Tin the motivation of an amoral character seeking well amusement Its not that they enjoy being good or evil  they may not know or care about the difference  but they do whatever they feel like without regard for others They dont need a motivation or justification for doing anything beyond the amusement of the act itself As a result they almost inevitably do things that are dickish maybe even cruel but generally not outright evil This same character will lead you into a trap fight you to the death and then stop on the brink of killing you to laugh and say Are you all right They wont kill the hero because they find their attempts to save the day amusing or are intrigued by the sheer selflessness of their thinking They may help the hero they may help the villain they may do both at once or screw over both at once They are rarely if ever a driving force behind a story but they nonetheless play a significant role And why do they do all this Why do they switch sides so often Why are they working below the Big Bad when theyre just as powerful and intelligent as they are if not more Why did they make out with the hero of the same genderBecause it was fun Theyd do just about anything for a lark reallyPlease note this is different from For the Evulz Whereas a character who commits evil acts For the Evulz does so because they like seeing other people suffering if this character does evil things it is only because they shatter the boredom of everyday life  the characters not out to hurt anyone per se but they dont care much if they doThey usually believe Victory Is Boring and if theyre a PunchClock Hero or a PunchClock Villain theyre in it primarily for the entertainment value Theyre incredibly dangerous to trust and even they know it perhaps noting how foolish the hero is to trust them In action movies they can be a really awesome fighter but they wont attack either side unless theres some entertainment value to be had or if their life is in dangerIf they stick with the good guys all the way through when victory comes they may leave to have more wacky adventures or maybe character development will have them taking things more seriouslyJust how much they care about collateral damage and hurting innocent people if at all varies One of the few ways to really make an It Amused Me character take things seriously is to put one of their playthings in dangerOften such a character will be the Wild Card an Enigmatic Minion or Chaotic Neutral A common saying of The Trickster characters the Eccentric Millionaire But be wary of the character devolving into Chaotic StupidAs you may have noticed the line dividing For the Evulz and It Amused Me is something of an academic distinction It is often hard to tell from a single act whether a character enjoys evil actions solely for the amusement value of the acts It Amused Me or whether they alsomostly enjoy the thrill of acting evilly For the Evulz Generally a character who truly does things For the Evulz will do things that arent fun or interesting in the name of evil which they seek at every opportunity  a character who does things because It Amused Them wouldnt bother because if its not fun or interesting why do it Such characters are not necessarily without a sense of morality as they have been known to minimize the collateral damage of their schemes for example or even to stop what theyre doing if they think theyre harming the wrong person or people Someone motivated by For the Evulz would never do thisOn the other end of the scale when a villain repeatedly gives this justification for supporting the protagonists it can overlap with I Was Just Passing ThroughThe trope is usually all the motivation one needs if one is a Troll See also The Gadfly who does things that trolls do but for reasons besides amusementSubtropes include Teasing from Behind the Language Barrier Prank Punishment Delighting in Riddles and Loves Secrecy,4119

Deep Cover Agent,They seem perfectly trustworthy The allAmerican housewife the happygolucky office worker or the freshfaced agency recruit Theyve got friends jobs and sometimes even families barring their parents who died in a tragic bus accidentDeep down however theyve got a dark secret theyre agents from another country or a rival organization sent on a longterm secret mission spending their free time or even work hours involved in Cloak and Dagger business In extreme cases the agent might have been planted as a child and have lived their entire adult life in their host country brainwashed into having total loyalty to their homelandTheyre not immune to the charms of their enemies homeland though and are sometimes in danger of Becoming the Mask though oftentimes their training makes them resistant to the temptationThis is often times Truth in Television even in a postCold War world This is known as nonofficial cover Typically however nonoficial cover doesnt mean you have an elaborate fake backstory complete with faked photos mysteriously deceased parents annoyingly vague work history etcetera  it usually means youre just you only with a secret second job that might put you at risk of death if its ever discovered Theoretically nonofficial cover means you only actually tell one lie  that being I am not a spySubtrope of Living a Double Life and Undercover as Lovers Add a sprinkle of NeuroVault and you get the Manchurian Agent Compare with Copied the Morals Too where a copy of a heroic character is created often to be a spy on the heroes but is unable to complete its mission because it received the heroic characters morals as well as their appearance Contrast the Diplomatic Cover Spy who work in the sending countrys embassy and dont need this much elaborate backstory to do their work because they have Diplomatic Impunity Thats Official Cover as in you are a government official and entitled to the diplomatic protections that are afforded to such persons  but have correspondingly less freedom to do human intelligence work because the other side have almost certainly worked out what you really are long before you entered their country,2149
Global Ignorance,Hulk Hogan Brother Ill leg drop your ass back to Beijing Kim JongIl Beijing is in China you blond asshole— Epic Rap Battles of HistoryTrade travel war and other interactions between nations and regions is an integral part of human history from the Silk Road to the Triangle Trade to containerization In fact in todays globalized world there is only a small handful of countries that are selfsufficient ie can support their own population with everything they need without needing to trade for it so geography has always been something that people would or should be aware of simply by virtue of the fact its A very difficult not to and B just seems a bit rude not getting to know your neighbors Thus when TV wants to show that a person is an idiot they almost inevitably show them making a geographic mistake such as mistaking a continent for a country or the inability to find a given location on a mapThis can be done with a character to demonstrate their status as The Ditz or with real people as part of a Selective Stupidity featureAlternatively it can be used to depict a character as being a shortsighted nationalist usually a resident of The United States particularly by Europeans who frequently use this trope as shorthand for stupid Americans who know nothing of the world beyond the continental fortyeight states Its not without its merits though a variety of studies have found that American students are among the least geographically literate in the world And yes for the record America is one of those selfsufficient countries probably not by coincidenceIn a variation a character insists on using the old names for countries that have reformed or gained independence such as Rhodesia a former British territory in Southern Africa now known as Zimbabwe Formosa Taiwan or Ceylon Sri Lanka In this case the character is oblivious to the changing political climes and has no interest in staying current If he knows the modern names but refuses to acknowledge them hes probably a Quintessential British Gentleman who wants to hearken back to the glory days of the empireA third possible use is to show a character as being out of touch rather than stupid by using the old names for countries that no longer exist but did exist in their lifetime like Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union Unlike the above example these characters are unlikely to be making a statement and are simply old or otherwise havent had any reason to check a map in the past decade A common side effect for anyone from the Soviet Bloc who Slept Through the Apocalypse of its disintegrationOf course there are greater and lesser degrees of this trope and it can be used in subtly different ways Not knowing the name of the capital of the country a character is currently in almost certainly is showing how the character is genuinely stupid and not knowing the capital of ones home countrystateprovince would definitely be considered stupid while being unable to name all of the former Yugoslavian republicsnote Slovenia Croatia Bosnia and Herzegovina Serbia Montenegro North Macedonia Kosovo is an interesting addition though as only 97 of the 193 United Nations members recognise its independence is unlikely to be saying a character is dumb unless its being asked by The Smart Guy to demean a character However this can backfire as the genius character demands another name—the capital of Belarusnote Minsk—and ends up stumping themselvesOften a character who isnt characterized as being either The Smart Guy or The Ditz will make understandable but amusing slips along these lines to cement their position in the intellectual hierarchy particularly if they have been being a bit too smart recently A good example would be thinking Thai people are from Taiwan which is wrong but not completely stupid eitherUsually a case of InUniverse Factoid Failure when it happens in fiction Can overlap with Eskimos Arent Real if the character refuses to believe that a country actually exists See also Artistic License  Geography,3999
I Uh You Too,Alex I uh Emma I uh you too— Alex  EmmaWhen a character cant bring themselves to properly confess their love so they either make a statement to similar effect or one that is totally unrelated The character on the receiving end of the pseudoconfession usually understands what they mean often responding with something along the lines of I first characters statement too,369
Cant Tie His Tie,Roger Ive already destroyed this telethon undoes Stans bowtie and untied your bowtie Stan No Youve given me a relaxed demeanor— American DadIts standard protocol for men to wear either a necktie or bow tie when dressed up formally But in many cases the guy just cant do it Often if theres a female companion she will end up doing it for him although he will not always be happy about it This is also sometimes used as a form of Ship Tease due to the necessary proximity required and may or may not result in a Necktie LeashOften Truth in Television since guys these days have the option of clipon ties or just dont dress up often enough to get used to it or bothAnother common form is a mother tying her sons tie Usually accompanied by comments about how handsome he looks or how grown up hes becomeIf a character manages to get their tie but does it incorrectly then it may be a Wardrobe Flaw of CharacterizationZip Me Up applies a similar Ship Tease element to female attire For another excuse to stand beside your love interest and touch them see HandsOn Approach,1066
FreezeFrame Bonus,Whats a VCRBack when I was writing and producing Dharma  Greg the only way to read my cards was to record each episode on a VCR and hit the pause button This was not an easy task The image wobbled like crazy making the tiny words of my weekly tomes very hard to see— Chuck Lorre Productions 182In video sometimes the screen will show something so briefly that you cannot tell what it is unless you play the video in slow motion pause it or go frame by frame on a CAV encoded Laserdisc Often it turns out to be a joke or a ShoutOut though it can sometimes be used for Foreshadowing in more continuityheavy worksUnreadably Fast Text is a subtrope of thisAlso called a Blink And Youll Miss It momentIts often good to link to pictures or actually describe whats seen when giving examples of this trope,797
Even Evil Has Standards, Even if youre a psycho clown nobody likes a Nazi And even Joker still cares about the American wayIll kill a man in a fair fight Or if I think hes gonna start a fair fight Or if he bothers me Or if theres a woman Or if Im gettin paid Mostly when Im gettin paid but eating people alive Wheres that get fun— Jayne SerenityOne of the easiest ways to highlight just how bad something or someone evil is have an otherwiseremorseless villain reject itIts often to show that a new villain is really bad if even Doctor Annihilation is appalled by them Another way that its used is to keep a villain safely on the still sympathetic side of the Moral Event Horizon give him something that he simply will not do It may be specifically invoked to prove that its OK for our hero to work with villains who have standards when the need is great enough This can be strange if handled badly with one character objecting to someones crossing a line even if they have crossed many many others leading to confusion and possibly an unintentional edge into BlueandOrange Morality Why after all should a criminal think shooting a particular single orphan be worse than killing every single orphan in the Throwaway Country or a serial killer be upset by petty theft or This might be deliberate however in order to show the Moral Myopia of the villains and make the viewers question what is right what is wrong and if there even is such a thing as more wrong Also to show how complex human beings can be what is acceptable for them and what drives them to make different choices in different scenarios It is particularly ironic when two characters display this and their different understanding of morality by objecting to each others crossingThe most common taboos of this type in contemporary Western works involve sexual violence or illtreatment of children Or both at once Common gangsterstory examples are to have the NeighbourhoodFriendly Gangsters by contrast with the Ruthless Foreign Gangsters refuse to sell illegal drugs or to be disrespectful and abusive in their treatment of the women who they pimp If your story takes place in a Mob War where one side is slightly better than the other its most likely because the good side has standards In older works or historical fiction with authentic moral attitudes common examples are breaches of Sacred Hospitality treachery against ones leader or general breaches of oathsThe trope title is frequently spouted by the Noble Demon in order to justify his evil selfidentification The typical format of their declaration is usually along the lines of I may be Y but I amam not an X Y as seen in the pictureThe Complete Monster in particular has a tendency to provoke invocations of this trope on the part of other villains due to having next to zero moral standards if that and even then theyre never treated as a mitigating factor for their ilk and committing atrocities even their fellow villains see as vile Complete Monsters themselves can never play this trope unless the example is either subverted later or Played for Laughs as they will stoop to whatever low they can to carry out their goals In a community of supervillains expect a Complete Monster to be The Friend Nobody LikesI Gave My Word is another common variant which may let the heroes agree to Combat by Champion Some villains may maintain their standards through use of a Villainous Vow You Monster and Screw the Money I Have Rules are used as common vow when this trope is in effectCan lead to an Enemy Mine if the evil is another villain Can also lead to a Pet the Dog moment Can contribute to making an AntiHero or Villain Protagonist A Lighter Shade of Grey than their enemies Can also make it so that a conflict where both major factions are malicious has someone for the audience to root for In rare cases a HeelFace Turn can even develop from the villain taking a Redemption Quest as a direct result of the conflict most likely from Heel Realization This can also be used to show how Villainous Ethics Decay is in effect if an older generation of villains proclaims that they have standards only for a Viler New Villain to come along and show that they have no such standardsIn comedy its often used to frame a Take That against a reallife action such as digital piracy or profession such as lawyer that the villain is too good to associate with or alternatively making fun of those who treat it as a crime its sometimes also played for laughs with Arson Murder and Jaywalking where the one thing that the villain objects to is something comically minor compared to their usual crimes Contrast Moral Myopia and Even Evil Has Loved Ones where the standards apply only to the villains allies and Arson Murder and Admiration where the eviler one is the better This trope is one of the distinguishing differences between most villains and The UnfetteredCompare and contrast Pragmatic Villainy when the villains refusal to partake in the abhorrent act is far more selfish or in the case of a group of villains against a single one groupbeneficial Eviler than Thou where the villain is dismissive of another villain for not being evil enough Even Mooks Have Loved Ones where minions defect to protect a loved one from their boss Do Wrong Right for cases where its not what is done but rather how its done that the villain has standards for Evil Versus Oblivion where one villain is trying to defend the world himself included against another villain who wants to destroy everything and FamilyValues Villain for where the standards are very oldfashioned Often the deal with many Lawful Evil villains but sometimes not Can occasionally be the cause of a Break the Badass moment when the badass in question is the bad guy As said above it may be used by a character who also crossed the Moral Event Horizon and so he may be in theory if not wholly just as evil as the target of this trope The Politically Correct Villain always considers themself part of this trope though whether the writer and audience agree tends to varySee also Hitman with a Heart where this Trope may apply Not all characters who fit the Professional Killer Trope are evil depending on their choice of targets but most are and a lot do have some scruples Theyre particularly likely to have the Even Evil Has Standards variant Selective SlaughterCan even involve Conscience Makes You Go Back Sudden Principled Stand Wont Do Your Dirty Work See also Evil Virtues and Villainous Valour for good traits and virtues that villains commonly practice The inversions of this trope are WellIntentioned Extremist and Utopia Justifies the Means when it turns out that goodness is willingly crossing the Moral Event Horizon This trope is a common trait in Affably Evil characters On the other hand while Faux Affably Evil villains do not possess much sincerity even they could conceivably have their limits A SubTrope of Everyone Has Standards Subverted with Pragmatic Villainy where standards are based not so much on ethics but a realization of the risks andor longterm consequences outweighing the shortterm gains,7075

FirstEpisode Twist,The first installment of a new series ends on a shocking reveal The only problem is that said big surprising twist may have already been spoiled for latecomers because it goes on to be the very premise of the series The series itself spoils its own first installmentThe way to tell if something qualifies as a FirstEpisode Twist is that it may be hard and in many cases impossible to accurately describe the series without completely ruining any of the suspense or setup that occurs during the first episode Conversely a firsttime viewer who doesnt know the premise could be genuinely taken aback by the unexpected development Think of how the first movie of The Matrix revolves around the mystery of what the Matrix is The reveal could be an actual surprise twist for an unknowing viewer but anyone who has heard the series described in any way already knows the Matrix is a computer simulationA FirstEpisode Twist also has to be treated as an actual twist by the episode Its not a twist if we meet a mysterious new character and then it turns out hes The Protagonist or the seemingly ordinary kid turns out to be The Chosen One or the protagonist starts out Too Happy to Live and suddenly things go bad Thats just standard plot setup as all first chapters have On the other hand if the first episode makes us believe that new character is The Hero but then it turns out hes the villain now we have a reveal that could be spoiledand probably is on the coverThis is most common in plotdriven series although it can occasionally be found in the pilot episodes of premisebased seriesFor a literary example to qualify the twist should take place within the first few chapters or the first book in a series or else it becomes just a regular plot twist In media such as manga or comic books the practice of Writing for the Trade might mean the twist does not take place within the very first issue but to qualify it should still be very early in the workFirstEpisode Twists are prone to being ruined by trailers or opening credits for the series As a result some shows use a truncated opening sequence or even forego it all together in the first episode in order to avoid thisIf there are Powers in the First Episode this becomes exponentially more likely Same for FirstEpisode Resurrection,2285

Characterisation Click Moment,Not all characters start off fully fledged Many undergo Character Development or alternatively even the writers dont figure out specifically what their shtick is until midway into the projectWhile this is often a slow building process very often theres a key moment where the shift begins and the character gains a primordial core that will be built on in stories to come This is that moment When the future iconic cast Jerkass demonstrates their first selfish moment when the upcoming Cloudcuckoolander makes their first nonsequitur when the Small Name Big Ego starts to take notice of their potential It may not be the most important and drastic evolution step especially if Flanderization comes into play afterward but it will be the clearest and most obvious starting point for where their later characterization starts to take overSee Characterization Marches On or EarlyInstallment Weirdness to compare it to the earlier personality these moments overwrite Compare Establishing Character Moment where the character intentionally demonstrates their personality as a first impression Dont confuse with broader Character Development — this trope is about a distinct moment within the arc of the character where the characterization noticeably clicks in a way it never had before not an organic change brought about by events within the storyIf the characterization click is key to the shows dynamic it may also lead to the media Growing the Beard,1449

pursuing said goal such as mass murder are problematic despite any sympathy they may have with their cause the heroes have no choice but to stop them Taken to extremes they may fully believe that Utopia Justifies the Means Such an idealistic extremist is likely to be either a Totalitarian Utilitarian or a Principles Zealot depending on whether theyre aiming For Happiness or For Great Justice The most wellwritten examples of this trope are the kind that the readerviewer stops just short of agreeing withOther times the villain may be out for simple revenge against a person corporation or other entity that has undeniably wronged them Again the heroes may sympathize with their plight but are obliged to stop them because they care not who gets in the way of their planned revenge However the heroes will often investigate the villains grievance themselves and will complement stopping the villain with bringing the offending party to justice as wellMaybe they started out with actions as good as their intentions but were forced to take more extreme measures Either way its a common end result of Jumping Off the Slippery Slope Their favorite phrase is I Did What I Had to DoThere are four basic flavors of Well Intentioned Extremist The problem is the means The Extremist has a good goal that many would support given that it is fundamentally good and noble but only the Extremist thinks the means they have chosen are acceptable Perhaps this particular road to utopia is Powered by a Forsaken Child or simply includes a nauseating level of socalled necessary sacrifices The Extremist has a good goal that many would support given that it is fundamentally good and noble but the means the TU has chosen have hiddenhidden costs Though itll solve the original problem itll bring about something even worse For example they may try to prevent crime by sacrificing everyones souls to an eldritch abomination so they will no longer have personalities or feel the desire to steal They may not have even realized that this is a problem The problem is the goal The Extremist has a goal that few would support given just how extreme and illogical it is Any principle can become Nightmare Fuel if one divorces it from common sense and basic human decency For example We should maximize the average happiness This can most easily be done by constantly and secretly exterminating the unhappiest people We should maximize the total happiness Since even starving people are capable of happiness we should raise the total population as high as possible regardless of each individuals quality of life Negative utilitarianism Instead of maximizing happiness we should only focus on minimizing suffering However since all living things suffer to some extent we can only eliminate suffering by putting the unhappy out of their misery  or by exterminating everyone We should just make everyone happy people who are unhappy should be cured of this condition using the latest technology or magitek The problem is the consequences The Extremist sees a real problem and offers a real solution that may or may not be ethically acceptable but the bigger issue is that they are not taking into account the negative sideeffects of their actions For example The Extremist wants to assassinate the evil dictator of an oppressed country but cant or wont take the time and effort to ensure that the country is not taken over by another who is just as bad or worse or perhaps the country falls into chaos without the tyrant or a stronger benevolent replacement to hold it all together The problem is the problem The Extremist has a goal that more or less everyone can agree is misinformed insane or both — theyre willing to make huge sacrifices in the name of a completely useless goal For example they might try to fix the endemic and civilisationdestroying catastrophe of anttheft by organising the sacrificial murder of the entire population of New Delhi as an offering to a nonexistent supernatural entity that they think will solve the problem with its magicOn the extreme end may result in the even darker Knight Templar who chooses to either remove free will believing it the best way to save the world or destroy whoever they dont consider worthy enough to live Unlike this The WellIntentioned Extremist isnt a punisher of all flaws or a dictator who argues that they are good and therefore everyone else is bad they actually realise that some of their victims dont deserve to die or suffer but insist that it is for the greater good and actually isnt entirely wrong They could also be a fallen WideEyed Idealist that was driven over the edge and sometimes a Worthy Opponent or even Reluctant Warrior Vigilante Man is a case where the WellIntentioned Extremist hasnt yet descended to the point of not caring who gets hurt Often ends up in rivalries with the Knight in Sour Armor Maybe theyre Obliviously Evil and dont realise theyre the bad guy in which case theyre prone to My God What Have I Done and becoming wracked with guilt and horror if theyre ever enlightened Some of those seeking to bring about a One World Order to end international strife may count as thisThis can be a difficult line to walk push too hard in one direction and you make it seem as if the extreme methods are acceptable push too hard in the other and you run the risk of denying the validity of their initial cause of arguing for oppression for instance instead of against it When the balancing is done they more often than not tend to be either AntiVillains or even dark AntiHeroes especially if put more emphasis on the wellintentioned part than the extremist one However there are some who seem like WIEs but in reality are just straightup villains particularly if they are the other way around in terms of what they put more emphasis on and if they are obviously just using their philosophy as a shallow excuse to commit evil Another version of a darker villain being this trope is that they have an actual philosophy which they believe will improve the world but the philosophy itself is too obviously evil to garner any sympathy such as is often the case with the Misanthrope Supreme and genocidal maniacs especially those who believe theyre in a GuiltFree Extermination War and act accordinglyOften these characters are presented as more dangerous and terrifying than some who are straightup For the Evulz and Take Over the World types and with good reason Even Evil Has Standards does not usually apply to them as it might be for some others After all if you think youre doing the right thing then its easy to consider even the most horrific actions an acceptable compromiseCompare with Necessarily Evil where the villain in question has a Heel Realization and recognizes that he deserves punishment of course he may always choose to just Ignore That Epiphany See also A Lighter Shade of Grey A staple trope of the Master Computer gone mad If the positive intention is overthrowing an evil government the Well Intentioned Extremists will be an example of The Revolution Will Not Be Civilized If his extremism actually succeeds in making the world a better place its The Extremist Was Right The Small Steps Hero desperately wants to avert this trope The Complete Monster will instead subvert this tropeAs this trope often goes handinhand with the FaceHeel Turn or may involve the reveal of a villains true plans or intentions expect spoilers,7579
Dragged by the Collar,What do you do when somebodys being stubborn or trying to excuse themself from a sticky situation Force them into it by dragging them away by their collar of courseGetting dragged by the collar is often used as a comedic device most often in anime though it does pop up in Western Animation sometimes The victim would more often than not be trying to escape an embarrassing predicament of his own doing before another person grabs him and drags his butt off to whatever mess awaits him The victims loud protests and flailing of arms are optional Small variants include getting dragged while standing with the heels skidding on the ground instead of the butt and stiff outstretched arms Sometimes instead of the collar characters are dragged by their cheeks ears arms or legs This is not always used for comedy however especially when the one being dragged away is unconscious injured or in severe cases deadSee also Necktie Leash which is similar to this only done for flirtatious or sexual reasons Compare Possessive Wrist Grab where a character aggressively grabs anothers wrist in a display of dominance and The Load in which the victim actually wants to tag along but the other characters wont let him Also see Angry Collar Grab The DragAlong is a metaphorical version a character who doesnt want to join the adventure but may well literally overlap with this trope For a Darker and Edgier version of this trope where the very act of dragging causes injury or even the death of the victim see What a Drag or Ankle Drag where the person is dragged by the ankle specifically and the person is rarely dragging them for their own good,1634

Comedic Sociopathy,Tragedy is when I cut my finger Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die— Mel BrooksComedy as has been noted before aint prettyJohn Cleese once noted when talking about Fawlty Towers that comedy is very much like tragedy the only difference being that comedy lacks sympathy towards the character This is often because the character in question usually doesnt deserve sympathy for example Basil Fawlty lives a life full of hardships annoyances and general misery but because he is antisocial and offensive towards his guests and staff often with little provocation and most of his misery is caused by his own actions you find yourself laughing at him rather than mourning his misfortune If Basil Fawlty were a decent person rather than an Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist Fawlty Towers would be a depressing exercise in watching a man being tortured undeservedly — a Kafka KomedyWe sometimes laugh when we see someone else get hurt Schadenfreude is a staple of humor theres no question about that but Slapstick is only acceptable in limited doses People just dont throw around banana peels like they used to Thus in order for humor to be committed writers must turn to the psychological equivalentThis means that in any given situation the ButtMonkey of the moment must be surrounded by people who are capable of making him miserable whether intentionally or not This capacity for cruelty and its lack of consequences comprise what we call Comedic SociopathySociopathy loosely is a condition in which a person is indifferent to or unaware of the rights and feelings of other people In comedy these symptoms show up in the darnedest places Any time a character needs to be trodden on put upon tonguelashed stung bashed insulted dejected neglected and all kinds of other mean nasty ugly things somebodys got to be there to do it to them This means that regardless of the personalities of all the characters involved everyone eventually develops these symptomsWhats amazing about the way this plays out is not that there will be characters who are mean snarky sarcastic and uncaring but the behavior of the characters who are not In order for the appropriate level of hilarious misery to occur other characters  even kind loving characters  must temporarily lose their ability to sense understand or care about the emotional discomfort pain and suffering that the current ButtMonkey is experiencing They may regain it when the plot calls for it but for that critical moment of gag the character is essentially a sociopath In the worst cases when theres a Writer on Board Comedic Sociopathy can cause characterization to break down completely allowing close friends to deliver cutting remarks like casually thrown knivesComedic Sociopathy can be seen in almost all comedy It is the root of shows like Seinfeld Family Guy and Fawlty Towers but it shows up just as readily on Sesame StreetSee also Heroic Comedic Sociopath a Comedic Hero who does this all the time and loves it This trope is what the Sadist Show and Black Comedy live off of This may result in No Sympathy in situations where the character is clearly deserving of it even if its about vengeance unless if the intended victim is an Asshole Victim and thus having their Karma Houdini Warranty expired Too Funny to Be Evil coupled with Rule of Funny is the basic principle that allows this trope to work Compare to Laugh with Me or Cringe Comedy When this trope gets taken to extreme overthetop levels its Crosses the Line Twice See also Disproportionate Retribution because in comedy this is usually okay If the example falls short on the comedic aspect and just comes off as cruel it may get the reaction Dude Not Funny Conversely if the butt of the joke is a good sport they may agree its Actually Pretty Funny,3782

Insult Backfire,What is that splattered all over the drawing Chunky spaghetti sauceThe other side wants to marginalize us and make us the outsiders Why not run with it— Brad Lavigne from the CBC biopic JackA verbal equivalent of Attack Backfire this is for when Alice comments on a trait of Bobs in a way thats intended to sound negative — but instead of being insulted Bob acts flatteredUsually this is because Bob invokes the insulting quality intentionally Less commonly Bobs The Ditz or has a poor grasp of the word or concept being insulted and take it to be a positive comment Other times its simply a case of Bob having the attitude of pretending that its not an insult or even turning it back on her Coming from you Ill Take That as a ComplimentA variant is for the character to be insulted not because they dislike what was said but because theyre obviously so much worse than thatOccasionally the insult backfires because Alices remarks were insulting on the surface but Bob carries them to their logical ultimately complimentary conclusion These cases typically only work when the original insult was mild andor nonmalicious to begin withRelated to Stealth Insult but different in that an Insult Backfire is accidental and a Stealth Insult is sent over the targets head on purpose Sometimes it seems the only sure way to insult someone is to give them a complimentNot to be confused with Insult Misfire where the target obliviously doesnt realize the insult was directed at them Compare Threat Backfire Compare and contrast I Take Offense to That Last One where there are multiple insults but the character may only object to one of them If you phrased your insult poorly You fight like my grandma you may get Insult Backfire through Literalist Snarking You fought

someone elses sarcastic compliment towards them as a genuine compliment Rule of Funny The character is a complete idiot who loves hearing other people talking about them whether positively or negatively The insult was done in such a way that the target is able to turn it around with a bigger insult For example if someone tries to Trash Talk an opponent while using an unfair advantage in a competition whether combat or something else and the target is able to turn it around by insinuating or straight out saying that the individual is unable to beat them without cheating Then again

Word of God,The preceding paragraph is all stuff I just made up But its canonical now— Sarah Monette writerA statement regarding some ambiguous or undefined aspect of a work the Word of God comes from someone considered to be the ultimate authority such as the creator director or producer Such edicts can even go against events as were broadcast due to someone making a mistakeFans may look for the Word of God to settle Fanon disputes but the Authority may have moved on and doesnt care to respond In many cases the authority does not feel the need to respond further pressure simply leads to suggestions that the fandom is misaimed In point of fact there are good reasons many creators dont respond to requests for this they want the fans to make their own interpretations Especially in an ongoing series where the creator knows facts the fans dont they might very well know for a fact that both fan theories have truth in them and thus not wish to take sides Alternatively the author might view both readings of the story as equally acceptible and thus not want to commentIts important to keep in mind that just because someone wrote a character or setting doesnt mean they decided on a correct answer to every question that could possibly be asked about that character or setting It is not at all uncommon for fans to ask questions which they believe to be obvious but which the creator has never considered In particular questions about a characters sexuality gender identity or race often fall into this category Everyones creative process is different Not all writers make highly detailed character charts or decide on details of a characters identity that arent directly plotrelevant The fandom might consider those details important because the work happens to speak to people who have a particular identity but that doesnt mean the author considered that fact important enough to spend time thinking about Culture can play a role here as well since what might be considered an essential fact about a person in one culture could be viewed as extraneous in another Japanese creators for example will often decide what a characters blood type is but may not pay any mind to their sexuality Western fans can find this very strange and frustratingThe other reason creators often refuse to answer questions about character identity is of course politics This is particularly likely to be true when the creator is in a different country from the fandom In the heat of internet discourse it can be difficult to remember that what is a pedestrian factoid in your country can be a hotbutton political issue in a different one Creators may have good reason to fear social or even legal repercussions if they answer questions like this something which fandoms are often not as sensitive to as they should be Creators whose primary motivation is profit may additionally not want to alienate parts of the fandom refusing to resolve Fanon disputes especially if they are politically tinged can be an effective strategy for doing thatA number of people reject the notion of Word of God being equal to Canon considering something to be canon only if it appeared in the original source material If the creator had wanted a certain fact to be canon the thinking goes they should have included it in the work to begin with Other audience members go even further considering the uncertainty and ambiguity of canon to be a good thing and decrying the Word of God as shackling the imagination and interpretations of the fans These attitudes have found some acknowledgement in literary criticism Wimsatt and Beardsleys The Intentional Fallacy and Barthes Death of the Author essay both argue that the interpretation of a work cannot be limited to attempts to discern the authors intentionsSomething else to consider is that often particularly when it comes to comedy shows creators may make statements that are meant as jokes or at least not meant to be taken seriously It may sometimes be difficult for people to tell if certain creators are making a genuine statement of canon or not So be careful when relying on things like humorous DVD commentaries and interviews on comedic talk shows for confirmation about somethingAnother thorny issue is that not all stories have a single creator and the collaborators may not actually agree with interpretations of their story that werent made explicit in the work This is especially likely if they no longer work together and particularly if they had a reallife falling out In this case there are multiple Gods given potentially contradictory explanations so whose word is to be considered correct Likewise in many cases the writers of a story are not the copyright holders meaning that theyre not the highest authorities on its meaning even if you do subscribe to the Word of God theoryIf a work has more than one creator and they disagree with each other on a crucial point youll likely see fans embrace conflicting statements What happens when multiple fans are equipped with the Word of God What happens when one Word turns out to be more ridiculous than expected Bible fight The term Story Bible is sometimes used for the definitive guidelines for writing an episode of a TV series Two writers quoting the Story Bible back and forth are having a Bible FightThis is also a way that a theory can be Jossed Its important to remember that if you disagree with the Word of God theres nothing wrong with writing fan fiction that contradicts it just dont try to foist your preferred Fanon on fans who acknowledge the official canon or on the actual creator of the workActors can be included under Word of God if they are the actual performers of the characters involved This is because in order to perform their roles most actors will spend time working out motivations backstory and even what a character is thinking in a particular scene So even if a scene does not actually have two characters say I love you to each other but the actors say that they played the roles as the two characters being in love and the writer of the story says they were in love then Word of God may then apply that they were in loveWhen the word does not come from the creator themself but from someone involved in some ancillary role in production thats Word of Saint Paul When the word does not come from the original creators but over time is still treated as such it is Word of Dante Doesnt always end up giving fans the answers they were looking for such as in the case of a FlipFlop of God where the creator keeps changing their mind on what isnt made explicitly canon by the actual work or multiple creators have different viewpoints on the works unexplained details Shrug of God where the creator chooses to let the fans come to their own conclusions due to either indifference or not being sure themselves or Writer Conflicts with Canon where what the creator says is canon is paradoxically contradicted by what is explicitly shown in the actual work Cases of God deliberately misleading the audience go under Lying Creator or Trolling Creator And then there are cases of fans either misinterpreting or just making up Word of God resulting in God Never Said That,7170

Contrived Clumsiness,To err is human Most people are aware of this and recognize that we are all prone to the occasional act of clumsiness and carelessness Hence when someone accidentally spills a drink or steps on a foot or knocks something over most people are willing to forgive and forget if an apology is givenHowever this also means that people can on occasion do something generally meanspirited to someone else in public and potentially get away with it if it appears to have been a mistake Of course sometimes the person doing this wants everyone particularly their victim to know it was done very deliberately and will communicate this by issuing an insincere or flatout sarcastic apologyWhether or not the character engaging in this behavior chooses to cover it with a sincere apology may depend on whether or not the character believes their audience will sympathize with the action For example if Alice is a particularly vicious and foul character who is not well liked Charlene might choose to issue a sarcastic apology after dropping a plate of tartar sauce on her cleavage her audience will smile because they all know that Alice had it coming and they are pleased with Charlenes courage knowing full well it wasnt really an accident On the other hand if Bob is a major Jerkass who is not especially wellliked he may attempt a sincere apology after accidentally tripping the much kinder and sympathetic Charlie he knows that those watching dont like him and the apology works as a preemptive defense Of course if Bob is very powerful he might decide not to put any effort into making the apology sound sincere since he really doesnt care what everybody thinks since theres nothing anybody can do about itThis type of deliberate accident is often motivated by spite or revenge although not always Sometimes its a necessity to divert someones attention gain someones attention plant a Tracking Device steal something or just get someone worked up The key to this trope is that an action is being presented as a mistake on the part of the person doing it Since theres no point in holding up such a pretense if alone this is something that will be done in public even if all thats available is an audience of oneUsually this action is more of an irritant than anything thats likely to cause serious injury or death but not alwaysCommon variants of this trope include but are not limited to The Drink Spill A character spills a drink or some kind of food onto another character or himherself The Foot Crunch A character steps on another characters foot or spears it with a cane The Fragile Object KnockOver A character bumps or pushes something brittle and sends it crashing to the floor The Trip A character sticks out a foot and trips someone The FingerSlip A character accidentally pushes a button or some other device that activates a device that should not be activatedSee also The Be Quiet Nudge in which a character punches or kicks someone and pretends it was an accident in order to get the other character to stop talking Compare Interrogation by Vandalism and Intentional Mess MakingThis trope bears no relation to the Sitcom Accidentally On Purpose,3150
DVD Commentary,Im sorry I am really sorry I dont know what I was thinking but Field of Dreams was good wasnt it Made us all believe againHello ladies and gentlemen Im Ronald Haver and Im here to do something which we feel is rather unique  the ability to switch back and forth between the sound track and this lecture track— Film historian Ronald Haver on the first ever audio commentary for the 1984 The Criterion Collection laserdisc release of the original King KongThe DVD and Bluray by extension Bonus Content with the highest ratio of disappointment when it isnt included to likelihood youll actually sit down and watch the whole thing If youve bought a DVD its assumed that you like the movie or TV show or whatever Fair enough It seems logical that a good chunk of the viewing audience would want to know more information about the film theyre watching and also to have a compelling reason to rewatch a film youve seen in the theatre The creators or other experts get together to record an audio and rarely video track to be played during the movie This track comments on the production process The Director often provides comments on the creative decisions However for some movies there might be comments from special effects creators set designers or stunt coordinatorsThough its inclusion is increasingly common there are several famous directors who refuse to allow commentaries to be recorded for their DVDs The most famous examples are Steven Spielberg David Lynch and Woody Allen Spielberg says he doesnt want to distract the viewer from watching the movie and anything he has to say about the film can be found on the DVD features Lynch is insistent on the Death of the Author issue and doesnt want to give his own definitive interpretation of the Mind Screw works hes famous for its for the same reason that hes a master of the Shrug of God Allen has stated that he hasnt seen any of his films since they were released and most of the DVDs dont even feature stereo sound and has also given the explanation that he thinks movies should stand on their own meritsKeep in mind that filmmakers are first and foremost artists and are sometimes much better at expressing themselves via visual media rather than verbally Tim Burton is particularly notorious for this as he admits that he has poor communication skillsAt their best DVD commentaries can be a wealth of informative entertaining insights into the creation of the film especially if the speakers are adept at the process They may also have the canon answer to things that need some explanation At the midpoint of quality everything in the commentary is interesting but was already discussed in other shorter special features on the DVD — making listening to it feel sort of pointless At their worst it can quickly devolve into an awkward selfcongratulatory sessionSometimes the commentary is nonexistent for long stretches sending you grasping for the remote to see if you inadvertently turned the track off A rule of thumb is that commentaries which feature more than one person commenting together in the same studio not spliced together will be more entertaining though not necessarily more informative than a solo track Some filmmakers have started including subtitles for the commentaryStill its always nice to know the commentary is there And if its not there or if its poorly done theres no reason why fans andor haters cant decide to go into the commentary business for themselves,3444
Affably Evil,The Mayor of Sunnydale Jovial Fatherly Wants to be a giant snake demonThis is very embarrassing It seems there is a red box in your car They cant get to it They want me to make you unlock the car I feel like an idiot I dont know what to say I am to torture you if you dont do it— Dr Kaufman Tomorrow Never DiesTraditional villains are evil in thought word and deed They Kick the Dog every day just because they think its funny they cant sympathize with the pain of others andor they think suffering is justified when it serves their cause Alternatively they may simply be too inscrutable andor inhuman to inspire anything but dreadThen theres these guys Theres nothing separating Alice from an ordinary nice person except that she wants to use an infants soul to power her Doomsday Machine so she can Take Over the World And youd never know it because you only see her when she invites all the neighbors over for a barbecue in her backyard A lessdeveloped villain would be the Stepford Smiler or the Bitch in Sheeps Clothing — but shes not Alices good humor is a genuine part of her personality Shes the very opposite of Charlie shes so thoroughly dedicated to Evil that she can be pleasant and kind in her daily life without any risk of slipping to the other side Alice would Kick the Dog she just petted if it got her closer to her goals but she wont do evil just for evils sake Shes devoted to her family fair to her employees and she enjoys a good reputation in the community because being antisociety doesnt mean you have to be antisocialIf this trope gets exaggerated Alice will invite Bob the hero out for an afternoon on the lake offer him a favorite dish talk to him like hes an old friend try to appeal to Bobs better nature and convince him that her plan for the world is a cause worth joining Of course a villain is still a villain and Alice has no use for Bob if he wont change his mind It may or may not involve a Death Trap depending on how nice she really is when crossed And Bob would have every reason to be nervous if she invites his mother over for tea insteadWhether an Affably Evil villain is less scary than the traditional type depends on how the work wants to play it They can be more relatable and sympathetic than a traditional monster especially if the work has a real villain as well and are often used in works intended for children to provide an antagonist without having them be too evil or scary Conversely they can be much worse theres something inherently terrifying about an ordinary even decent person with a pleasant personality doing

with an Insult Backfire Captives of an affably evil villain wont be kept in dungeons but in a Gilded Cage Even an outright psychopath can be charismatic and funny enough to fit this trope or at least to convincingly waver between true and false friendliness since the contrast is explained by their mental instabilityIn the event an Affably Evil villain does undergo a Villainous Breakdown the very traits that make them so pleasant often serve to make their breakdown extremely creepy or outright scary A kind friendly man suddenly going into a psychotic rage is so much more frightening than a man

malicious as the rest Too Funny to Be Evil The villains good sense of humor makes people think they couldnt possibly be a bad guy Villain Respect They consider the hero a respected rival and Worthy Opponent Sometimes theyll even join the hero in the fight against Eviler than Thou villains Villain with Good Publicity Nice villains dont fake politeness to get by in society they earn a good reputation through fairness and public largesse Villains Out Shopping A glimpse of genuine humanity in an otherwise evil person Often a trait of a CardCarrying Villain especially in the more ironic

of both A and B When Shao Kahn arrives to merge his realm with Earth out of the surviving four heroes only Raiden remains Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade are too beaten to stand up to Shao Kahn and are easily dashed aside and Liu Kang has died trying to kill Raiden As the triumphant Emperor steps forward Raiden falls to one knee and consigns the Earth to him Its kind of like A since the elder gods have decreed that merging the realms without victory in a Mortal Kombat tournament is forbidden so Raiden could be seen as supplicating the Emperors ego and drawing him into a trap However it could also be considered B as at this point Raidens faith that the elder gods will do anything to help the Earth is more or less gone and he could be simply trying to hand over the Earth to Shao Kahn

Limited Animation,As a cartoon blues man might say if it wasnt for limited animation we wouldnt have no animation at all— Fred Seibert in defense of HannaBarberaThe practice of using mixandmatch parts in animation rather than having a completely new drawing for every new frame This trope also covers using deliberately abstract character designs and backgrounds that will not obviously clash with the low production valuesThe technique was popular in the early days of animation and can be seen in JR Brays first animations and early comedy shorts like the Colonel Heeza Liar series since it had very stiff animation to the point of basically being moving comic stripsThe more detailed and realistic animation of Disney and Fleischer Studios would eventually take over and dominate the field until the 1940s and 1950s when two things happened Chuck Joness The Dover Boys short over at Warner Bros and John Hubleys everything at United Productions of AmericaJohn Hubley from UPA was a wellknown advocate of limited animation as art He encouraged animators to experiment with primitivism and expressionism in the 1950s and 1960s leading to the development of some pretty trippy stylized backdrops and character models that would became a major influence in the following years with most Western television animation owing something to UPA shorts like Gerald McBoingBoing to some degreeSpeaking of television its place in the widespread reemergence of limited animation definitely cannot be forgotten While Chuck Jones and John Hubley were playing with limited animation from an artistic standpoint studios like HannaBarbera and Filmation quickly recognized it as a way to save time and money Television work had much smaller budgets and required quicker turnaround times for a finished product than cinema and limited animation provided a muchneeded middle ground between expensive full animation and the motion comic style of previous television works like Crusader Rabbit This didnt stop Jones who believed that the best animation can be watched without a soundtrack from being extremely critical of HannaBarberas cutrate animation style though dubbing even this more comparatively lively approach illustration radioThe radio comparison isnt entirely inaccurate however limited animation leans heavily on its writing and voice acting due to the rather limited visuals While most works live and die by the strength of their story limited animation especially forces the creators to write well and for the voice talent to have excellent delivery as the spectacle of fun cartoony or flashy actionpacked animation will not save them because there isnt any Unless youre Studio TRIGGER anyway You see Japanese anime also uses limited animation but in a different way than the West Alongside reusing drawings things like lessfrequent eye blinks keep down costs even more while speed lines with abstract backgrounds rendered long shots of incredibly detailed backgrounds and a long list of visual tropes keeps the audience more visually engaged in a manner that is often lacking in Western productionsFinally in a certain sense all animation is limited in one particular way with very few exceptions its foreground animation over static backgrounds Or for something like a train passing behind some buildings or trees background animation over static foreground In very early animation eg Gertie the Dinosaur the environment was redrawn for each frame In very short order it became clear that drawing your characters separately and laying those drawings over that environmentlocation that might not change for minutes at a time was the best way to do things Today this technique is so universal it scarcely bears mentioning Scenes where the background is not static are incredibly rare very expensive and can look pretty odd CG animation operates under different rules but the basic principle is still the same focus the bulk of your time and processing power on the characters rather than any environmental elements they wont interact withnote Interactive environment is the reason for the Conspicuously Light Patch in traditional cel animation for the recordThough because there is a difference between Limited Animation and fully produced animation it can become used for an Art Shift as contrast for the main work which is especially popular for exposition or flashback narrativesAs technology has progressed the ability to produce animated storyboards became more common with the advent of software like Flash and Toon Boom which may be released to the public as promotional material Its primary use is being able to use crude CG or hand drawn images on top of a similarly crude background for the more detailed animation to use as a guideline for final editing and vocal timing The same process has been used for animated comics where genuinely hand drawn comics are animated via voice over use of The Ken Burns Effect or simplistic effects plugins like smoke and fire Video Games also use it by necessityNowadays on TV it is a Discredited Trope because TV animation has become fuller and fluid since the 1970s and the 1980s and onwards but this method can be used for Web animationsSee also The Dark Age of AnimationCommon SubTropes By the Lights of Their Eyes Everybody Do the Endless Loop Ring Around the Collar Stock Footage Talking Heads Unmoving Plaid Wheel o

Drill Sergeant Nasty,You call this a trope entry maggotIf you ladies leave my island if you survive recruit training you will be a weapon You will be a minister of death praying for war But until that day you are pukes You are the lowest form of life on Earth You are not even human fucking beings You are nothing but unorganized grabastic pieces of amphibian shit Because I am hard you will not like me But the more you hate me the more you will learn— Gunnery Sergeant Hartman Full Metal JacketRISE AND SHINE MAGGOTS YOU ARENT WORTHY OF CALLING YOURSELVES TROPERS UNTIL IM THROUGH WITH YOUDrill Sergeant Nastys job is simple — turn the bunch of new recruits hes been charged with training into lean mean fighting machines The more you hate him the more you will learn So he gives you Training from Hell to break you down so he can build you back up But often he seems to revel in the breaking a lot more than the building In a way hes the military trainees equivalent of a Mean Boss but theres seldom any other typeThe only training method that Drill Sergeant Nasty knows is The Spartan Way He yells He carpet bombs your ears with profanity He makes you scrub floors with toothbrushes He will make you drop down and give him 20 50 or whatever arbitrary number he comes up with He tends to use Sound Off in drills a lot Eventually youll hate his guts which is usually exactly how he wants you to feel He is usually based on R Lee Ermey who actually was a Marine drill instructor for two years or a Scary Black Man see Louis Gossett JrOn kids TV this same character is a gym teacher coach or another authority figure but not necessarily a Sadist Teacher Hes often a former drill instructor who has trouble hanging up the chevrons The fact that the Presidential Fitness Test which was used as the benchmark for fitness in US schools from 1956 to 2013 was primarily a milestone of fitness for the military might have contributed to this stereotypeThe work will often imply that Drill Sergeant Nasty is right abrasive though he may be everything he does is for your own good and everyone will come out the better for it or at least better able to survive Hell Of course in the film Full Metal Jacket the Trope Codifier drives one of the recruits into a mental breakdown that results in his murder and the recruits suicide an outcome that you almost never see in any other examples despite being the progenitor of such a characterHe will often address those under his command as maggots ladies morons or any other insults he can think of to motivate the people under him He may also dish out often derogatory nicknamesIn Britain the popular image is of the Sergeant Major who is usually much less abusive but no less demanding and may or may not be marching up and down the square If a British work has Shown Their Work this role may well be filled by the Provost Sergeant who is in charge of base discipline and who the drill sergeants send recruits to go and see for their punishmentIn something of an ironic twist the popularity of this character has impacted real military training Recruits often enter with at least a passing familiarity with the trope and dont take it or the instructor seriously However such an attitude is likely to earn such recruits a lot of extra PT physical training screams in their face and a very harsh reminder of why its not a good idea to diss your superiors in the military Drill instructors drill sergeants sergeant majors etc have to go through quite a bit of training of their own to get where they are as well as having good records of service in whatever military branch they serve in Plus military or otherwise making someone mad at you who knows how to kick your ass seven ways to Sunday is not very smartThis often spills into works that depict normal life in the military more often than not a higher ranking officer or noncommissioned officer NCO will randomly scream at the low private and punish him with pushups or a random exercise This tacticnote known as getting smoked beasted in British Army slang is rare nowadays as most of the US Armed Forces branches have banned this practice outside basic training and the OfficerNCO themselves would get a far worse punishment for having ordered the punishment but it still happensA very specific example of The Neidermeyer that unlike that trope will seldom lead his men into actual combat because his job is to train them then send them on to their next assignment Compare Sergeant Rock the guy who leads them once Drill Sergeant Nasty is done training them Compare Weakness Is Just a State of Mind where the sergeant may abuse the idea that their troops lack of drive and ability is a delibrate decision not from a medical problem or dangerous depletion of strengthThe Drill Sergeant Nasty is one of the best examples of the ZeroApproval Gambit It instantly provides 40 people who have nothing in common with one unifying dream namely the sergeants slow painful and embarrassing deathCompare Veteran Instructor,4982

Playing Catch with the Old Man,In fiction a game of catch always shows the relationship between two characters The most common type is a fatherfigure with their childTo qualify as this trope two or more characters play catch in a manner that immediately tells the audience everything they need to know about their relationship At least one pair of the characters have a parental relationship The relationship can be symbolic Its efficient storytelling serving to establish those characters in just a few seconds of screen time In fiction one game of catch can tell the audience this guys a good Dad in about ten secondsIf the parent playing catch is a motherfigure instead it can reveal she has to play the roles of both father and mother because the father isnt in the picture or that Mom is a bit tomboyish If the younger player is a girl shes often depicted as a tomboyOften the younger figure demonstrates their maturity or precocious strength by throwing the ball hard enough to make their partners hand sting When done in a positive light it shows that the young character is growing up and growing strong When shown in a negative light it shows conflict between the two that can be generational When inverted with the parent throwing hard enough to hurt the younger player it demonstrates a lot of immaturity on the part of the parentIn another variant not making time to play catch with ones child is always synecdoche for being a neglectful or distant parent A single shot of the disappointed child tells the audience everything they need to know Likewise offering to play catch is always a sign of one reaching out to the other The other partys reaction to the offer shows their view of the relationship It can be the parent reaching out to the child or the reverseVariants of this trope include fielding the ball instead of just playing catch using a soccer ball hockey puck or similar sporting gear where its more appropriate and using objects normal people would never play catch with such as characters with SuperStrength using boulders,2019

Naked People Are Funny, Boy its a good thing people know these are hand puppets otherwise this would be the pic for The PornomancerYou know what they say revenge is a dish best served NUDE— Sheldon Cooper The Big Bang TheoryNudity is one of the last great taboos particularly in The United States Whereas its OK to show violence blood and to a certain extent hate speech on TV a tiny bit of nudity will cause an outright scandal Just ask Janet Jackson and her nip slip which got more attention than the show she was putting on at the time despite its sexually suggestive content that some say bordered on sexual assault by her costarThe proper term for the above phenomenon is gymnophobia fear of nudity It often reaches the point where people are afraid of so much as seeing nudity even accidentally One main reason so many people are afraid is the fear that they might like itSo while nudity itself is right out the insinuation of nudity as well as the usually gymnophobic reaction to it is just titillating enough to make it onto the air especially on comediesNaked people are funny after all especially paired with a prudish costar to react to them or in a situation where theyre not expected or wantedA character who ends up naked or at least in only their underwear in a situation they dont expect such as losing their Modesty Towel and they will lose their Modesty Towel in public

Censor bonus points if it is a Gag Censor Almost always theyll end up meeting another character meanwhile the audience will have to make do with at best a Toplessness from the Back or ShouldersUp Nudity shotThe Invisible Main Character probably cant wear clothes if only because the insinuation that he or she is running around naked makes it funnier  plus when the character does inevitably materialize itll invariably be in front of as many people as possibleThe Innocent Fanservice Girl wont understand why everyones freaking out while the Shameless Fanservice Girl wont care Ms Fanservice and The Vamp will understand but thats the ideaIts tempting to suppose that nudity is funny precisely because its so unusual in the civilized world and weird things are naturally funny However this logic goes out the window when you learn that nudity has been a prominent ingredient in humor for at least 3000 years Even the ancient Egyptians found naked people funny and they werent themselves shy about wearing little more than loincloths So maybe the humor lies primarily with boobs and penises which have been shameful to expose since Neolithic timesSpecial mention goes to nudism Nudism is a philosophy that basically boils down to Theres nothing wrong with being naked in certain situations including some group situations The Theme Park Version of this is Hey look naked people and is a great way to throw some Fanservice or even funnier but much grosser Fan Disservice into your show Nudists tend to be shoehorned into a few specific roles depending on their role in the plot If a character is introduced as a nudist that character will be either extremely young and attractive or extremely old and ugly depending on whether the character is being played up for Fanservice or comedy with few exceptions Middleage and underage nudists do not exist although the latter have some very obvious reasons for their omission Has a touch of realism in it  real nudist organizations often have a pattern of children dropping out as they enter adolescence then returning in middle age after they become comfortable with their bodies again As a general rule any nudists will be new age hippies or if theyre old actual original hippies Talk about mantras releasing the inner calm etc is common Depending on age nudist characters are either airheads or old Zen masters  the younger you are the stupider you get Said nudists will either be extremely puritanical and often militant about their nudity socalled Right to Nude activists demanding the right to go naked on a local beach for example or extremely perverse in which case they are really swingers Almost universally they will refuse to acknowledge or genuinely not recognize that they are making other people uncomfortable with their nudity nor will they ever get uncomfortable themselves This one has a surprising amount of truth to it Revelation of said nudism will cause on average one character to react angrily and one other to reveal that they have always been interested in nudism were really raised as a nudist or experienced something similar in their past For example sunbathing on the beaches during a European trip These will almost invariably be an upset man and an openminded woman or an extremely interested man and an extremely offended woman If theres any sexual tension between the two itll almost definitely be that couple If there is a third person it will likely be the perverted friend who completely misses the point and spends the entire episode trying to sneak peeks or take photos If there is an older cast member he or she will probably already be naked when everyone else arrives If a male or female character decides to go to a nudist beach or resort to look at women or men said women or men will either not exist or be extremely old If a character disrobes at a beach and neither a sign clearly saying Nude Beach nor other nude people are visible it will turn out that it is not in fact a nude beach The character either went to the wrong beach was misinformed maybe it used to be a nude beach or just assumed it was a nude beach most likely because theyre tourists who think all the beaches in whatever country theyre in are clothingoptional or because theyre from a country where in the writers imaginations all the beaches are clothing optional Although again some Truth in Television to this as the United States is almost uniquenote The only other similar country is China without even a single legally protected clothing optional beach Every Nude Beach in the US is instead politely ignored by the local authorities and not actually legally protectedEspecially common during Sweeps See also Useful Notes NudismFor specific examples of nudity as humor see Birthday Suit Surprise Party  Events conspire to leave a character nude for a surprise party Embarrassing Hospital Gown  Events conspire for a character wearing a hospital gown to expose themselves Naked People Trapped Outside  Events conspire to trap a character naked outdoors Open the Door and See All the People  Events conspire for a naked character to be surprised by a mob upon opening a door Gone Swimming Clothes Stolen  Exactly What It Says on the Tin Invisible Streaker  Logically if you are invisible that doesnt mean your clothes are The Nudifier  A character ends up naked because they were exposed to something that disintegrated their clothes,6968
Home Alone Antics,And wacky antics ensuedNamed after and popularized by but not started by Home Alone Home Alone Antics are an unusually specific trope At its most wellknown form a kid sets traps in or around a house and bad guys who are after the kid or the house or something inside the house end up getting hurt by the trapsThere can be variations on the concept It doesnt have to be a kid who sets the traps or tricks the bad guys — in fact in one movie it was a dog The traps dont always need to be set they can be part of the architectureenvironment However the one required aspect is dumbgoofy villains being tricked into falling for the traps in a comedic mannerThis is the Lighter and Softer version of Protect This House and a variant of the Humiliation Conga A subtrope of Slapstick and by extension Die Hard on an X Related to Home Field Advantage as the kid is probably setting up the traps in his own home or some place hes more familiar with than his opponents For more serious takes on the trope outside kids or their homes see Trap Master,1037
Latex Perfection,Just to show its not a real faceThe ageold mask device Weve seen it a million times— The Brain Arthur BuggedIn fiction fullhead pullover latex or silicone masks can be made so perfectly that it is impossible to tell the wearer from the person he is impersonating until the moment he pulls off his face by grabbing an invisible seam at the back of his jaw Sometimes the mask is pulled off by grabbing the top of the headEven close acquaintances and family members will be fooled Masks of this quality can completely alter the shape of the wearers face and head even to the point of making them thinner or smaller as needed regardless of common sense or physical law If you want to make out with someone while wearing one dont worry—the person youre kissing will never notice your face feels like rubber rather than skin Best of all for those who need them masks of such exquisite detail can be made without resorting to casting the face of the target—a couple of small blackandwhite photos will do just fine as a referenceTypically a mask like this can even easily mimic the wearers expression making it easier to fool others In animation the wearers eyes can sometimes change to match the eyes of who he is impersonating or the mask may have molded on eyes that seem to become real when the mask is worn Regardless the mask will almost always have eyelids that blink with the wearers something that is rare with such masks in real lifeThis is the number one tool of the Master of Disguise Its not seen nearly as often in modern TV but it still lurks about and surfaces every now and then The Darkman movies for example and the opening of the first Charlies Angels 2000 film Sometimes the unmasking is done in a rather dramatic mannerIf a man disguises as a woman this way the unmasking can often be seen as an Unsettling GenderRevealThis trope can be nightmare fuel for some people especially if its accompanied by a graphic peelthefaceoff shot and it often is Woe to the Masklophobic who runs into a film using this trope especially if they dont know its coming and gets treated to seeing an actor remove their faceIf its around Halloween then this trope may come into play as thats the time of year when people can be expected to wear rubber masks Also expect to see this in parodies of the secret agent genre particularly spoofs of Mission Impossible which gradually made this trope into a cliche but sometimes in James Bondstyled spoofs as well despite the films in that franchise not using it as often  see Film for their examples,2535
Speed Sex,There are Super Bowl commercials that last longer than you Malcolm— Keisha A Haunted HouseOne of the standards of sexual prowess for a guy at least in fiction is how long sex with him can be expected to last Thus a male characters real or alleged inability to maintain a Raging Stiffie long enough for it to provide much pleasure for his partner is a frequent subject for insults gossip or selfdeprecating humor Sometimes it has implications of selfishness if the guy is only interested in his own orgasm and assumes sex is over once its happened or inexperienceineptitude premature ejaculation also features often here followed by a swift cry afterwards Men might Think Unsexy Thoughts during the act to delay their orgasmWhile this can be a problem for men in Real Life it tends to be exaggerated in fiction mostly for purpose of comedy You may also find numerous references to seven minutes out there in trope land Rest assured seven minutes is actually the median time for an act of human sexual congress but that doesnt mean a session cant last more than seven minutesSomething that can be just as much of a problembut rarely gets depicted in fictionis an inversion when a guy can keep going and going without ever reaching an orgasm himself no matter how hard he tries In that case a guy can get discouraged with sex and worry that this inability to climax from sex with his partner will hurt their feelings It is a more common problem for male virgins who have a lot of prior experience with masturbation they find that actual sex feels different and that twoway communication is required to figure out an arrangement that pushes the right buttonsNote that Speed Sex is the norm for many animals particularly prey species that cant afford to leave themselves vulnerable to attack for longer than a few seconds For example chimpanzees and gorillas both only have sex for about thirty seconds The reason humans last so much longer than their closest cousins is because its a different sexual strategy which also explains the differences in our penis shapes and testicle sizes Humans have the largest penis chimps have the largest testicles and gorillas are the smallest in both Their penises are also pointy where humans have a bulbous head Gorilla males compete to make sure theyre the father by maintaining a harem and preventing other males from having access to sex with them hence no need for much semen Chimpanzees have large colonies with parity among the sexes so the competition occurs inside the vagina with chimps pumping out copious volumes of semen to flush out their competitors and leave a plug to prevent others doing the same Meanwhile human penises act as pumps to scoop out competitors stuff which takes a lot of time but we hope to prevent a competitor doing the same so we need more volume than gorillasCompare The Loins Sleep Tonight for when he cant get it up in the first place and Lousy Lovers Are Losers for when someone is an overall unsatisfying lover If the couple decides to do something else sexual instead check Technical Virgin A man ejaculating before he can even get his clothes off is Jizzed in My Pants,3146

Wouldnt Hurt a Child,His employers thought he was the only one who could kill a kid They were wrongNo women no kids— Léon The ProfessionalMany adult viewers and writers are upset about kids being harmed Kid viewers arent but then kids arent the ones doing the writing are they As a result many characters on TV Wouldnt Hurt a ChildThis is often done simply by not showing kids at all in action and suspense shows but sometimes its rather conspicuous when characters seemingly go out of their way to not hurt kids or circumstances happen to conveniently align themselves so that kids dont get hurt For example a slasher movie where the slasher just happens to not encounter children in hiding or the kids manage to be rescued just in time while the adults and teens get killed Its also pretty common that when Even Evil Has Standards not harming children is one of themThis does not mean that the act cannot be referred to in the story Youll hear characters in plenty of films and TV shows talking about the antagonist harming or killing children That is much different from actually showing it onscreenIn fact when this trope does get averted and children do get harmed it can often be shocking for the audienceSee Also Wouldnt Hit a Girl for the femalespecific version of this trope and You Wouldnt Hit a Guy with Glasses for the now much less common standard of never hitting someone whos wearing glasses See Friend to All Children for those adults who not only dont hurt kids but will actively protect them even if the adults in question are clearly evil For video games see Hide Your Children where children arent even portrayed so as to avoid the implications that they could be hurt For a more specific form of Wouldnt Hurt a Child in which very young children are shielded from danger by the plot due to societys squeamishness about hurting babies see Improbable Infant SurvivalA common subversion is when a character who goes by this motto has to face a Creepy Child a Child Soldier or worse an Enfant TerriblePlayed with in the cases of Villainous Parental Instinct when it isnt that the person wouldnt hurt a child but that they wont hurt their childMay be a form of Heroic VowOddly enough its also Truth in Television as many gangs such as the Mexican Mafia brutally murder their members that hurt children likewise La eMes rules of conduct prohibit members from being child killers or child molesters This even extends to prison where inmates or even prisonbased gangs that welcome robbers and murderers into their fold will not tolerate someone who hurts a kid In fact killing one of these people often results in being wellliked by the other inmates people imprisoned for child molestation are often put into solitary confinement not as punishment but for their own protection due to a combination of this trope and Rape Is a Special Kind of Evil Of course this can also be seen as a Moral Myopia as there have been criminal gangs especially Mexican drug cartels and terrorist organizations such as ISIS and AlQaeda that use children for prostitution drug trafficking assassinations and other criminal activities mainly because children are the least likely people who would commit criminal acts thus catching other criminal gangs military and police forces offguardCan overlap with Pragmatic Villainy as while a villain may have no personal qualms with harming a child they are well aware most of the world does Harming a child would only complicate their plans by creating more enemies than they may be equipped to handle andor alienate potential and current alliesMay cross paths with What Measure Is a NonHuman where a character may question if killing a creaturemachine with the age or mentality of a child would be the same as killing a human childContrast Child Hater and Would Hurt a Child,3790
BlackandGray Morality,When your bad guy is this bad almost anyone can become a good guyMegan Wait Youre my hero Wade No no no no no That I aint narrating Nope never will be Im just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck up worse guys— Deadpool 2016It is often found in fictional media that the protagonistantagonist conflict takes the form of the shining knight who smells of flowers and has holy light shining from his every orifice versus the very fount of all evil who Eats Babies as a hobby and Kicks Dogs as a professionIn an effort to portray realistic conflicts writers often introduce flaws in their heroes and redeeming qualities in their villainsThese can be deeply unsatisfying Moviegoers want a hero to celebrate and a villain to vilify But if both sides have flaws and redeeming qualities how do they know which is which How can a writer create such a satisfying world without making it all impossibly unrealisticIts simple leave the job halfdone Only the white gets removed leaving behind a Crapsack World populated by people who each have their own forms of imperfection Without the option of becoming the saint the world needs newcomers of this world are stuck between the choice of supervillainy and faulty heroism This is the essence of Black and Gray Morality where the morals of characters can range from somewhat good to pure evilObviously the heroes of such settings tend to be antiheroes In such a world any characters who appear to be good in any way will eventually be revealed as a Knight Templar in disguise a Dark Messiah inches from the edge or a deeply flawed AntiHero And if there are any genuinely good characters on the show theyll quite likely either come around to The Dark Side die horribly remain a figure of perpetual mockery or if very lucky grow a protective shell of cynicismA good litmus test for this trope is as follows Do the protagonists regularly get away with ruthless or amoral actions Are they still unquestionably painted as being on the right side By virtue of the other side being worse Whether the author is successful or not does not matterIf so its a classic case of Black and Gray MoralityAs always it is important to remember that Tropes Are Tools It can be taken to an extreme where the choices are between Pure Evil and Good Because the Writers Say So This can make the protagonist difficult to sympathize with and lead to Too Bleak Stopped CaringAn alternative method would be to have one side be of A Lighter Shade of Grey against the black so while the heroes are flawed and may have to do some questionable things for the greater good they wouldnt try to indulge into unnecessary morally questionable actions Beware though as this could lead to a downplayed form of BlackandWhite MoralityFor serious cases where both sides are so black there are no more shades of grey among them anymore see Evil Versus EvilSee also Shades of Conflict GreyandGray Morality BlackandWhite Morality Crapsack World Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism The inverse is But Not Too Evil Contrast with WhiteandGrey Morality where everyone has some nobility to them and Designated Hero which is what happens when the story portrays a side as White when the audience sees them as Gray or Black Compare World of Jerkass if both sides are assholesIf there are true heroes around along with the kinda bad and very bad characters described above its The Good the Bad and the Evil Coming from the opposite side is A Lighter Shade of Black where an Evil Versus Evil conflict is left with one mildly sympathetic side by not making them as unrelentingly evil as their opponents while both factors are still anywhere from rather consistently dangerous to plain evil A heightened version of this is Sympathetic Villain Despicable Villain where the mildy sympathetic becomes very sympathetic and may be capable of redemption especially in comparison to the unambiguously evil,3878

Artistic License  Space,Captain weve been attacked by some sort of force ray Gah Gyah Space air is flooding in Right Goggles on— The Planet from Outer Space The SimpsonsThanks largely to Science Fiction space is probably one of the most inaccurately portrayed things in modern media to the extent that complete falsehoods are widely accepted as factEarlier media can get a pass since they were made in a time when there hadnt been much research on the subject yet Modern portrayals of space however still havent changed much from the rockfilled noisy place where an unprotected human can instantly explode into clouds of ice However some of the modern misrepresentations can be put down to the Rule of Cool Rule of Drama Acceptable Breaks from Reality or simply the belief that audiences wouldnt accept it any other way,795

Misplaced Retribution,Also known as Displaced AggressionThe Shield who claims to fight injustice ambushes Kane and Daniel Bryan who are faces Josh Mathews What injustice did Daniel Bryan do here tonight John John Bradshaw Layfield Hes associated with Kane thats enough— Friday Night SmackDownSome retaliation exceeds whats being retaliated to in its severity But some retaliation isnt even along the same line its directed at those who cant reasonably be blamed for what youre retaliating for except according to exceedingly shaky justifications or even no real justification at all or the culprit stole the victims identity Whether it is worse than what is retaliated to or milder the point remains that it is still unjustly directed at the wrong targetsClosely related to Misblamed Can result in a Misdirected Outburst A Sister Trope to Disproportionate Retribution and Revenge by Proxy and so more often than not Moral Event Horizonworthy Similar to Cartesian Karma Guilt by Association Gag and Karmic Misfire I Will Punish Your Friend for Your Failure is when one uses this trope as a threat Abusive Parents and Domestic Abuse may apply to this trope Its one of the many ways in which a Cycle of Revenge can get ugly Avenging the Villain is also related since The Hero or whoever killed the villain is usually either blameless or justified Yet another related trope is Bewildering Punishment which is what this trope probably feels like from the victims POV The Chain of Harm can result if the victim goes on to inflict this on somebody else The ButtMonkey or Cosmic Plaything is often on the receiving end of this when its Played for Laughs For cases where someone deliberately ensures this happens see FrameUp and The Scapegoat Not to be confused with Never My Fault which CAN through the aforementioned FrameUp and The Scapegoat cause Misplaced RetributionTruth in Television of course From a psychoanalytic point of view this is called displacement and occurs when someone who feels under attack emotionally retaliates against someone who is a better victim than the aggressor — for some reason it is more viable to emotionally attack this new target than the aggressor Blame the Paramour often overlaps with this in that trope regardless of how a cheating lover behaved its the new lover who is blamed regardless of the circumstances that caused around the affairSee Murder by Mistake when this trope is taken to the extreme,2411

Never My Fault,Gus In these situations we must emulate the Prime Minister Dave What cock it up and then blame someone else— Drop the Dead Donkey Pilot episodeIts never easy to admit that we are responsible for our actions and deserve to be blamed  in fact for some people its one of if not the most difficult things to do  and it is often far more comfortable to play the Blame Game and convince ourselves that it is the fault of another even though this is the cowards way out We may blame others even when we know deep down in our hearts that it is our fault Due to the Rule of Drama fictional characters will blame themselves for things going south most of the time but there are some cases where the character who really is to blame will blame everyone else instead Common variations include The person stuck with the blame fails to defend himself perhaps out of sheer dumbfoundedness at the other persons gall The blameshifter offers an absurdly flimsy pretext for ducking responsibility The character does this all the time and consistently gets away with it The person cant comprehend what they did is wrong because of how innocently they did it The person genuinely believes that they acted in an acceptable manner in response to anothers unacceptable provocation and genuinely believes that others are wrong for feeling angry with them The person thinks theyre the last sane person in a world of unreasonable idiots therefore anyone who blames them is wrong The person thinks theyre morally correct or righteous and thus it is impossible for them to be at fault because they did the right thing even when it wasnt The person never outright denies responsibility but instead dodges the issue entirely usually via a bunch of platitudes about becoming a better person without ever actually taking direct responsibility for their behaviorSubTrope of Psychological Projection This is a frequent component of Comedic Sociopathy and Revenge Myopia The diametric opposite of Its All My Fault or At Least I Admit It A character prone to this will likely try Glad I Thought of It too Compare Hypocritical Humor which can involve a similar blindness to ones own flaws and Implausible Deniability See also Its All About Me and Narcissist which are key reasons why a character would fall into any of the above Also compare Backhanded Apology an insult disguised as an apology where the perpetrator attempts to shift blame onto their victim eg I am sorry you were so stupid as to fall for my deception If the character doesnt blame others but isnt sorry for what shes done see The Unapologetic however the two tropes can overlap generally when the character says I Did What I Had to Do This trope is the defining characteristic of The Unfair Sex Can overlap with Everything Is Racist when the person blames their failings which are clearly their own fault on societal prejudice and hatred towards people of their racegendersexual orientationtaste in musicwhatever If the person is upset that their victims dared to fight back she is likely Feeling Oppressed by Their Existence A rebuttal to this trope would involve Stopping the Blame GameThe formal term for this is selfserving bias and it is a key personality trait of both The Sociopath and the Narcissist Related cognitive biases include the defensive attribution hypothesis as well as the fundamental and ultimate attribution errors Even in the average person the brain is designed more for selfdefensiveness and maintaining its own comfort than for strict accuracy explaining why it can be so difficult for people to accept they made a mistake or change their opinions even in the face of clear evidenceCompare with Mama Didnt Raise No Criminal for parents that try to shift blame off of their kids rather than themselves Subtrope of the Sin of PrideNOTE Please remember that examples of people blaming others for something thats clearly the fault of someone else ie a third party is not an example of this trope thats Misplaced Retribution This trope is only for when people attempt to shift the blame off of themselves,4058
AxCrazy                    aka Axe Crazy,Do you like Huey Lewis and the NewsLizzie Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks And when he saw what she had done she gave her father fortyone— American Nursery Rhyme note For the record Ms Borden was acquitted but never lived it down There were also far less whacks in the actual murdersAn axcrazy character is someone who is psychologically unstablenote Unstable is an excessively mild term here because it implies that some residual stability may still be present Being AxCrazy usually implies that almost the entire substructure of sanity is gone and presents a clear and present danger to others They are capable of extreme violence whether carried out with a Slasher Smile insane laughter speaking in a Creepy Monotone andor WordSalad Horror or out and out murderous rage and with no way of knowing just what will set them off this makes them extremely frightening to deal with This mainly differentiates them from other eccentric characters who may themselves be obsessive weird or seemingly crazy but use this condition hand in hand with doing good or at least not being in the way However some formerly established heroes can go through an episode of axcraziness and still retain their heroic mantleDespite the title axcrazies arent limited to wielding axes Any instrument of death will do from knives or straight razors to swords to chainsaws and beyond A good number of other axcrazies are also TriggerHappy preferring either Hand Cannons that blow really big holes in people or weapons that allow them to kill lots of people with reckless abandon such as any automatic weapon And for the truly disturbed for whom the above just wont do a heaping helping of high explosives or a goodsized flamethrower will do quite nicely Sometimes they dont even need weapons and just use magic spells or other powers if they have them There are also plenty who are just as happy to beat people into an unrecognizable pulplike mass with their bare hands Less outwardly violent and unstable examples are likely to be the vindictive and vengeful sort any sort of petty slight real or imagined is likely to trigger a Disproportionate Retribution and these types tend to be the more dangerous variety due to the lengths to which they will go to carry out their revenge and make the party who attracted their wrath sufferIt is rare for a truly AxCrazy character to be a protagonist largely due to it being a SubTrope of Obviously Evil and most AxCrazy characters usually are Obviously Evil Theyre common as the antagonists in Superhero and Crime and Punishment Series often serving as a Psycho for Hire If they are a protagonist they will most certainly be a Nominal Hero Villain Protagonist andor Heroic Comedic Sociopath The difference between them and Blood Knight is this trope is all about killing while the Blood Knight is only interested in fighting There is of course plenty of room for overlapSee also Insane Equals Violent The Berserker The Butcher The Dreaded Mad Bomber Cute and Psycho Blood Knight Psycho for Hire Yandere The Sociopath Mad Doctor Pyromaniac HairTrigger Temper Colonel Kilgore General Ripper Insane Admiral Sociopathic Soldier Holy Is Not Safe Psychopathic Manchild and Jerkass Gods Compare and contrast Mama Bear Papa Wolf Big Brother Instinct and Violently Protective Girlfriend who may be capable of temporary AxCraziness when their kids younger siblings or mate are under threat but are often played sympathetically Compare HotBlooded in which the character may have such tendencies but in a less threatening way even if both could overlapContrast Suicidal Pacifism when a character never ever resorts to violence even if it is necessary and Extreme Doormat when a character is a complete pushover unable to fight backThe canonical Character Alignment for most AxCrazy characters is Chaotic or Neutral Evil though a couple of Chaotic Neutral examples exist The AxCrazy characters twistedness may land them comfortably in Stupid Evil or even Chaotic Stupid in more satirical works Sometimes The Unfettered depending on whether they feel freed or enslaved by their bloodlust At least one or more examples are an AntiVillain where you kinda feel bad for them since their enemies pushed them too far with actions such as killing their family their friends or even the enemies trying to kill them making them go AxCrazy — they may be a Woobie Destroyer of Worlds The Heroic Comedic Sociopath is almost always AxCrazy as their inability to control their madness is a good way of having a Bloody Hilarious character who is still innocent enough to be a little sympatheticIts very common to be Played for Drama usually as either the Big Bad or The Dragon to the Big Bad It is far less common but not unheard of for it to be Played for Laughs this is most likely to be seen in a Sadist Show especially one featuring a lot of Comedic Sociopathy andor heavy Satire with it appearing most often in humorous comic strips Anime Web Original works and the more adultoriented Western Animation of the Renaissance and Millennium periodsThis page is about violent crazy people not people

Abandoned Catchphrase,Character Catchphrases are a great and simple way to help a characters image But sometimes catchphrases dont stick Perhaps the writers were experimenting with one early on but eventually decided against it Or perhaps a catchphrase was done to death and is no longer funny Or sometimes a character simply evolves and the catchphrase no longer fits the character,360

What Exactly Is His Job,But that monster messed with the wrong crew With Candys spirit Grendas strength Dippers brains and uh Soos here well get five hundred pieces of candy and have fun doing it too—Mabel Pines Gravity Falls SummerweenOften especially in media with a large ensemble cast there is one character whose function in terms of his internal purpose within the cast is a bit fuzzy The details of this role are left purposefully ambiguous Sometimes the general nature of the characters role is quite evident for example the character might be big intimidating and good in a fight but this naturally raises the question of just why the group needs someone who is big intimidating and good in a fightThis is often lampshaded by someone unfamiliar with the group and their adventures pointedly asking What exactly is his job anyway When the question is Played for Laughs the answer the newcomer gets is almost always something absurd This can typically be paired with The Main Characters Do Everything since there are usually recurring characters whose purpose is ambiguous and the main characters can easily function without them Its also common for an everyman because the lack of specific role allows more of us to sympathize with the characterRemember this Trope is about a persons undefined or unsuitable role among the main team not about how a person earns his keep between episodesCompare the Omnidisciplinary Scientist who has a PhD in Everythingology and awesomeology rather than merely having to be everything and awesome and Open Heart Dentistry for medical professionals who dont have a specialty,1591

Shaming the Mob, Jasper What have we become Dr Hibbert Weve given the word mob a bad name— The Simpsons RosebudThe mob is out in force toting Torches and Pitchforks and demanding blood All that stands between them and their target is our hero The hero gives a speech and the mob is ashamed Dejected they turn and leaveThis sometimes works on a Powder Keg Crowd as well but only if done before the violence breaks out Once the riot starts nobodys listening,439
Extreme Doormat,What a pussyThey cant break you if you dont have a spine— Wally DilbertHumble quiet obedient stoic the Extreme Doormat is all of these virtues and thats all they are A doormat is a slang term for someone who lets other people walk all over them much like the mat youd wipe your feet on before coming into someones home The Extreme Doormat lacks drive ambition boundaries and in extreme cases even opinions Something about them just drives them to make everyone happy even at the expense of their own happiness and kowtow to every order and insult theyre given no matter how ridiculous or unfair it may be to themNaturally such a narratively empty character wont start drama so theyre usually a Satellite Character Battle Butler trusty companion or part of a love harem for the more active hero Part of being the Extreme Doormat is that they will obey just about any command from their loveherosuperior officer short of the suicidal ones and sometimes even those Sometimes this can result from an Empty Shell with combat training under Mind Control Or it could result from a character who Desperately Needs Orders as it would be a possible way for them to get people to give them ordersA common Character Arc for the Extreme Doormat is the discovery or growth of their own personality and backbone Be it by having a true friend Teach Him Anger confronting their abuser or being the subject of Character Development or even a MookFace Turn when the hero who treats them nicely encourages them to abandon a boss who doesnt or a lover who keeps them dependentFrequently Apologises a Lot Often the victim of those Taking Advantage of GenerosityContrast Yamato Nadeshiko and Silk Hiding Steel both of which appear to be this trope but have a hidden backbone that will not bend and HairTrigger Temper who will overreact about anything Compare and contrast Love Martyr which is mostly not this trope Goes with Conditioned to Be Weak where a powerful character is only docile and submissive because they are conditioned to follow orders andor fear their leader,2052
Where the Hell Is Springfield,Each of these states are hundreds if not thousands of miles away from each otherIts a bit of a mystery yes but if ya look at the clues you can figure it out— Lisa Simpson being unusually cryptic The Simpsons Blame it on Lisanote All of the clues given in the episode completely contradict each other such that its impossible to draw any conclusionThe location of the city state region or sometimes even the country in which a work is set is never revealed or intentionally hiddenIts most often used as a Running Gag but it can also be used in drama to create an atmosphere of mystery and uncertainty Leaving a location unspecified can help it serve as a geographic Audience Surrogate It can serve to create a City of Adventure if only because very few real locations have every possible thing to see and do Other times the writers simply never see a reason to bring it upCreator Provincialism and No Communities Were Harmed come into play if the location is vaguely based on a real place but here the difference is that the creators can also play fast and loose with the accuracy Nevertheless fans will still sometimes go to extensive effort to piece together clues and pin down the location which usually just leads them to conclude that its set wherever it was filmedThe trope is named after Springfield the hometown of The Simpsons which even has its own Separate Simpsons Geography Thing Springfield is one of the most common namesnote  34 cities 3 unincorporated communities and 36 townships eleven in Ohio and nine in Pennsylvania for towns and cities in the United States so the name serves as an indicator of an Everytown Americanote Although if you are wondering the city with the most legitimate claim if you can call it that is Springfield Oregon as the shows creator Matt Groening is from that state and has used many elements from Oregon as inspirationCompare City with No Name Everytown America and Fictional Province Contrast No Communities Were Harmed and Canada Does Not Exist where the setting is based on a reallife location but never outright identified and Informed Location in which the location is clearly specified If the place is given a generic Mathematicians Answer of a name then its a Business of Generic Importance The temporal version of this trope is Ambiguous Time Period,2306
Episode Title Card,After the Title Sequence but before the first act many shows will put in an intertitle displaying the episodes title For some shows the title will be animated and a character from the series will read the title to the audience mostly prevalent in anime while western cartoons that use this are usually aimed at preschoolers On the other hand some shows might have the title be onscreen text displayed with the opening credits over the beginning of the first act It is also common for the title to never be shown and the name of the episodes only found from episode guidesThese days one tends to see episode titles only on nonprimetime animated programming although even then there are many exceptions to this For example 4Kids Saturday morning block didnt use episode titles on screen at all regardless of whether the original versions of the shows had them Most other kinds of programming eschew from explicitly titling the episode on screen with most exceptions being hourlong scifi Heroes Star Trek Doctor Who or for some reason the Aaron Sorkin dramas The West Wing Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and The Newsroom,1116
Worst News Judgment Ever,Stop the pressesnote The squirrel was later assassinatedRussia and the United States are at war Missiles have been fired by both sides Washington and Moscow are in flames Details on these and other stories in just a moment but first this word about hair care— George CarlinExhibited by entire newspaper editing teams at our heroes hometown papers the Worst News Judgment Ever gets relatively mundane news stories placed in prominent locations ie A1 above the fold bannered across five or six columns and with an overblown mug shot Our heroes have an easy time finding whatever they happen to be looking for usually seeing the paper in a vending machine With that sort of placement you dont even need to buy the paper  its all in the giantprint headlineUsually the news judgment is so wildly overblown as to cause disconnection from the audience you will rarely if ever see a Lampshade Hanging pointing out this ridiculous fallacyWhile improbable in the real world the overplayed story in question usually provides our protagonists with a Red HerringOn the other hand if the main headline is earthshattering enough one may start to wonder why there are any other articles on the front page at all When the main headline reads Extinction of Humanity Imminent then how in the heck is New Petitions Against Tax newsworthyIn a comedy or an old movie will manifest itself at the end of a Spinning Paper montageThere is also an inverted version of this trope that is usually used intentionally for ironic purposes an important story often describing the events that occurred in the movie weve just seen is shown stuck in a corner on the newspaper while a vapid story such as a celebrity scandal sucks up the headline space The paper is showing terrible judgement by emphasizing the wrong story Given among other examples the protest of MSNBCs Mika Brzezinski over having to lead with a Paris Hilton story when there were several more serious stories worthy of attention this could be considered Truth in TelevisionThis variant is almost always used as a commentary on societys preoccupation with meaningless gossip but it is sometimes used to show that the world has virtually ignored a story that would have changed everything such as proof of the existence of aliens vampires or similar In this case its not so much bad judgement  the paper would have no way of knowing that the freak meteor shower was the remains of a destroyed alien invasion fleet  but probably still counts as an example of this trope because the audience knows that the small story is actually of critical importanceSometimes this will be used as a joke the main plotimportant story is used as the main headline with an even more important story stuck in a corner For example in The Trapped Trilogy one newspaper main headline was about a serial killer escaping A smaller one was the second coming of Jesus Christ Some times youll find comments about the lack of meaningful other news as a jokeOften used to demonstrate that Old Media Are Evil Likely to take place in smalltown papers or school newspapers Compare Coincidental Broadcast when used to relay plotrelevant information and Yet Another Baby Panda when news broadcasts conclude with a fluffy piece See also Local Angle Kent Brockman News often features this Contrast If It Bleeds It Leads where the only important info that gets reported to death is the most miserable Proportional Article Importance is when a reader of the newspaper misjudges the importance of an article,3503
Both Sides Have a Point,This trope is under discussion in the Trope Repair ShopAvram gestures at Perchik and Mordcha Hes right and hes right They cant both be right Tevye You knowyou are also right— Fiddler on the RoofThis trope is when two or more opposing sides of an argument eventually realize that each side has a point and that they shouldnt be fighting each other They usually come to this realization by either talking it out with each other or by being influenced by a third party In works that decide to include a third party into the equation this character has to be the middleman between two sides In order to resolve the argument this character decides to judge both sides fairly and vocalize the strengths of each sides arguments The purpose of this tactic in the storys narrative is to enrich the morality of the setting and avert BlackandWhite MoralityCompare What Is Evil where a villain tries to invoke this to challenge their status as a villain to begin with with varying possible degrees of justification and success depending mostly on whether the works approach to morality is more Black and White or rather Grey and Gray Compare also The Horseshoe Effect for those strange cases in which both sides actually have the same point despite being ostensibly opposed to one another Contrast Culture Justifies Anything where its very likely that at least one side does in fact not have any valid point Not to be confused with Double Weapon where both sides of your weapon have a point Compare GreyandGray Morality as well as Rousseau Was Right and Good Versus Good Characters stuck in this situation may decide to Take a Third Option If only one side is portrayed as valid instory but the other also has one in practice thats Strawman Has a Point Beware of falling into the Golden Mean Fallacy where a compromise is reached but one side is flatout wrong and has no valid point after all,1880
Serious Business,This is bowling There are rulesSomebody said Footballs a matter of life and death to you I said Listen its more important than that—Bill Shankly 1981 TV interviewSerious Business is when a story revolves around an activity where a sizable portion of the InUniverse population takes it far more seriously than they should If the popularity of some mundane object rivals that of Elvis Presley The Beatles and Michael Jackson combined or if there are mainstream schools devoted to it instead of teaching reading writing and arithmetic then its Serious BusinessIts often a Silly Reason for War and can turn a casual conversation into a heated Cavemen vs Astronauts Debate Someone who just cant let it go may become a SingleIssue Wonk If competition is involved you can almost guarantee that Second Place Is for Losers Frequently opposed by the Cavalier Competitor Compare Stop Having Fun Guys In musicals its often demonstrated that Dancing Is Serious Business For the saying that The Internet Is Serious Business see GIFT Related to Im Not Here to Make Friends Not to be confused with Mundane Made Awesome though the two tropes overlap plentyCompare Duels Decide Everything Comical Overreacting When a relatively minor crime is treated as Serious Business thats Felony Misdemeanor Contrast Not a Game and Matter of Life and Death A SuperTrope to Overdramatic Dating Commotion where dating or the mistaken thought of it is treated like its a huge deal,1447
FourFingered Hands,Five fingers ooh freak showYo Im Casper Sup Gimme four Oh God Id kill for a pinky— Casper CasperWhy do so many cartoon characters only have a thumb and three fingers Simple a fourfingered hand is SO much easier to draw than a fivefingered hand Plus it simplifies the design of the hand in the same way the rest of the body is simplifiedAlthough this simplification has been on a decline in cartoons starring people it has never completely gone away This only appears in more cartoony styles action or dramatic series wont usually use this and it rarely shows up in Japanese works for several reasons Yakuza members traditionally chop off fingers if they are unable to pay back a debt or as punishment for other offences that dont warrant death The fourfingered hand is taken as a derogatory and often offensive reference to the burakumin caste four fingers  four legs  animals also its easy to lose a finger through the sort of dangerous labour to which burakumin are often relegated The number four in Japanese also means death and is seen as highly unluckyThis only really applies to human characters there are still plenty of animal alien or monster characters with eight fingers most likely due to some form of What Measure Is a NonHumanQuite often Western fourfingered characters have to be edited to have a fifth finger Interestingly this does not include Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse despite Disneys popularity in Japan—see Kingdom Hearts Not a fan of their works being edited in any way Disney is said to have paid USD 5 million a year to Japanese pressure groups to avoid being sued for Mickeys insulting fourfingered handsnote This was mentioned by the creators of the Oddworld video game franchise in their book where they also say they had to edit a finger off the players character to avoid similar extortionThis trope is not limited to depiction of humanlike characters Animal characters from any point along the Sliding Scale of Anthropomorphism can also be depicted with a reduced number of digits on each paw when compared to its reallife equivalent — typically three visible toes on a given foot rather than four although some of the earliest cartoons simplified it even further depicting only two digits on a given foot Actually sometimes the fact that the characters are not humans provides an excuseFunny Animals in particular often combine fourfingered hands with threetoed feet This is excusable when human characters in the same context also exhibit fourfingered hands but it can be jarring if the humans have fivefingered hands or if other animals in the same context are depicted with the correct number of digitsThose with fourfingered hands are often seen wearing White GlovesCompare Fingerless Hands when a character has completely no fingers Contrast Extra Digits when a character has more than 5 fingers andor toes,2855
AxCrazy,Do you like Huey Lewis and the NewsLizzie Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks And when he saw what she had done she gave her father fortyone— American Nursery Rhyme note For the record Ms Borden was acquitted but never lived it down There were also far less whacks in the actual murdersAn axcrazy character is someone who is psychologically unstablenote Unstable is an excessively mild term here because it implies that some residual stability may still be present Being AxCrazy usually implies that almost the entire substructure of sanity is gone and presents a clear and present danger to others They are capable of extreme violence whether carried out with a Slasher Smile insane laughter speaking in a Creepy Monotone andor WordSalad Horror or out and out murderous rage and with no way of knowing just what will set them off this makes them extremely frightening to deal with This mainly differentiates them from other eccentric characters who may themselves be obsessive weird or seemingly crazy but use this condition hand in hand with doing good or at least not being in the way However some formerly established heroes can go through an episode of axcraziness and still retain their heroic mantleDespite the title axcrazies arent limited to wielding axes Any instrument of death will do from knives or straight razors to swords to chainsaws and beyond A good number of other axcrazies are also TriggerHappy preferring either Hand Cannons that blow really big holes in people or weapons that allow them to kill lots of people with reckless abandon such as any automatic weapon And for the truly disturbed for whom the above just wont do a heaping helping of high explosives or a goodsized flamethrower will do quite nicely Sometimes they dont even need weapons and just use magic spells or other powers if they have them There are also plenty who are just as happy to beat people into an unrecognizable pulplike mass with their bare hands Less outwardly violent and unstable examples are likely to be the vindictive and vengeful sort any sort of petty slight real or imagined is likely to trigger a Disproportionate Retribution and these types tend to be the more dangerous variety due to the lengths to which they will go to carry out their revenge and make the party who attracted their wrath sufferIt is rare for a truly AxCrazy character to be a protagonist largely due to it being a SubTrope of Obviously Evil and most AxCrazy characters usually are Obviously Evil Theyre common as the antagonists in Superhero and Crime and Punishment Series often serving as a Psycho for Hire If they are a protagonist they will most certainly be a Nominal Hero Villain Protagonist andor Heroic Comedic Sociopath The difference between them and Blood Knight is this trope is all about killing while the Blood Knight is only interested in fighting There is of course plenty of room for overlapSee also Insane Equals Violent The Berserker The Butcher The Dreaded Mad Bomber Cute and Psycho Blood Knight Psycho for Hire Yandere The Sociopath Mad Doctor Pyromaniac HairTrigger Temper Colonel Kilgore General Ripper Insane Admiral Sociopathic

AxCraziness when their kids younger siblings or mate are under threat but are often played sympathetically Compare HotBlooded in which the character may have such tendencies but in a less threatening way even if both could overlapContrast Suicidal Pacifism when a character never ever resorts to violence even if it is necessary and Extreme Doormat when a character is a complete pushover unable to fight backThe canonical Character Alignment for most AxCrazy characters is Chaotic or Neutral Evil though a couple of Chaotic Neutral examples exist The AxCrazy characters twistedness may land them comfortably in Stupid Evil or even Chaotic Stupid in more satirical works Sometimes The Unfettered depending on whether they feel freed or enslaved by their bloodlust At least one or more examples are an AntiVillain where you kinda feel bad for them since their enemies pushed them too far with actions such as killing their family their friends or even the enemies trying to kill them making them go AxCrazy — they may be a Woobie Destroyer of Worlds The Heroic Comedic Sociopath is almost always AxCrazy as their inability to control their madness is a good way of having a Bloody Hilarious character who is still innocent enough to be a little sympatheticIts very common to be Played for Drama usually as either the Big Bad or The Dragon to the Big Bad It is far less common but not unheard of for it to be Played for Laughs this is most likely to be seen in a Sadist Show especially one featuring a lot of Comedic Sociopathy andor heavy Satire with it appearing most often in humorous comic strips Anime Web Original works and the more adultoriented Western Animation of the Renaissance and Millennium periodsThis page is about violent crazy people not people whose preferred weapon is an

Body Wipe,A oncecommon wipe used for Scene Transitions the Body Wipe is an In Camera Effect when the camera zooms in on a person to the point of that person obscuring the whole screen before the film cuts to somewhere else The faster the person goes the more intimidating this can be to the audience since it feels like the character is running or falling where it may feel like Camera Abuse out of the screenVariants A common method is for someone to walk into the camera and then cut to them walking out of it again somewhere else that is the same thing in reverse showing that they have travelled between their body filling the screen and their body moving away from it again This uses the Match Cut technique if the person is wearing the same colour on both sides of their body meaning that the transition doesnt involve sudden changes or cuts on the screen The camera can be placed in a chair that someone then sits in Expect a squelching sound to occur as the screen fills up with their body emphasising either that yes this scene is over and done and squished into history or the fatness of the character Played for Laughs the camera might hit the person and trigger a reaction from them instead of transitioning to another shotA SuperTrope to Eat the Camera in which the screen fills up with someones mouth Compare FlyattheCamera Ending when a similar effect ends the movie Not to be confused with any Bathroom Tropes,1415

Kicked Upstairs,The most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage—management— Scott Adams The Dilbert PrincipleSometimes someone working for an organization cannot be eliminated but isnt actually wanted in his role Perhaps hes far too eager but incompetent or is good but has some crazy ideas or just annoys everyone Maybe the only reason he has this role is that hes the boss nephew and hes terrible at the actual job Maybe he cant be fired because of some complicated union situation or because employment law heavily favors the employee rather than the employer in this setting Rather than being eliminated normally they can get promoted beyond the point where they get to do anything damaging or given a role that serves no useful functions except perhaps giving the appearance of workplace diversity Or the employee can be given a vitally important task that really isnt worth the effort and may even be a Snipe Hunt Alternatively the role assigned might be significant but the main advantage of putting the character there is that it would be a long way from anyone else you care aboutThis can often be used as an excuse of why an authority figure of an obscure topic is so awful at his job He got kicked upstairs into the position This is the most benign fate of a PointyHaired Boss He goes from incompetently micromanaging your every task to incompetently giving vague company mission statements Other times however an organization kicks someone upstairs for more unethical reasons like silencing a potential whistleblower with a higher salary and a cushy but meaningless positionIf the first thing we see of a character is him being kicked upstairs you can bet that his job is about to become Serious BusinessIn his book The Peter Principle Dr Laurence J Peter called moving an incompetent employee to one of these jobs Percussive Sublimation This is closely related to the Lateral Arabesque in which the incompetent employee is kicked sideways instead of up either way the personnel in question get shuffled over into a new position of theoretically equal status if not higher but which doesnt have nearly as much effect on the situationJapanese firms call people assigned to this madogiwazoku literally bythewindow tribe assigned to what seems to be a position of prestige and respect for a venerable company elder that has no real power or subordinates except to look out the window and wait to retire or die These positions are usually looked upon with disdain by both other people within the company and the people assigned to them In Japans workaholic society this position is essentially forced preretirement when retirement is basically viewed as one step short of death and generally leads to boredom and low selfesteem from not being a valuable part of the company and by extension society However to the modern Japanese society kicking people upstairs with the intent of forcing a resignation out of the victim is considered a sign of a black companynote a company that regularly violates human rights laws by running on the same principles as those of a sweatshop and in one extent has been ruled illegal Sadly it does not prevent other companies in Japan from continuing the trendAlso while this move has a demoralizing effect towards Japanese people it has the opposite intended effect towards westerneducated hipsters and snake people as noted by the series Silicon ValleyIn the Soviet bureaucracy the phrase was otfutbolit na cherdak kick up to the atticThe name of the trope comes from British politics where the Upstairs in question is the House of Lords Being given a title like Lord or Baron sounds like a great reward for a career in politics — until you realize that it disqualifies you permanently from sitting in the House of Commons where all the real decisions are made Winston Churchill was offered a Earldom or a Dukedom after WWII but he turned them down so he would retain his prospects for becoming Prime Minister again and also so his eldest son could pursue a career in politicsYes Minister popularized the phrase in recent times But it dates to 1684 when the post of Lord President was given to Laurence Hyde First Earl of Rochester after his mismanagement of the countrys finances His contemporary Lord Halifax commented I have seen people kicked down stairs but my Lord Rochester is the first person that I ever saw kicked up stairsA similar term applied more to the office itself than the person being promoted to it is sinecure for a job that involves little or no actual work It comes from the Latin sine cura without care the term originated in the medieval church where it meant a job for a priest that did not directly involve ministering to souls such as being a bishops secretary but also a job with no real duties Of course not all promotions or appointments to a sinecure are examples of being Kicked Upstairs but depending on what the persons old job was and their employers motives for putting them there they certainly can be The deputy leader post in most governments eg Vice President of the United States is widely considered one of these therefore leading to the trope Vice President WhoMay or may not include being Reassigned to Antarctica in the process Often leads to a Reassignment Backfire and as mentioned earlier if the character is important or this is how we first see them then this is practically guaranteed A supernatural version of this can be Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence When the kicking is done by a family member its Nepotism Contrast with Promoted to Scapegoat For the competent but nonactionoriented position of authority see Desk Jockey If the person in question becomes dissatisfied then it crosses into Disappointing Promotion If the occupation is intentionally vague as to limit power see Obliquely Obfuscated Occupation,5850

Irony,When fire fights backIrony The one form of humor that everyone thinks they understand when actually no one really does Truly it is the cleverest joke ever played on mankind— Surviving The World Lesson 618There are different kinds of irony In verbal irony the intended meaning of words is the opposite of the literal meaning of those words In situational irony the actual outcome of an action is the opposite of the intended effect of that action Basically youd think A but in reality what really happens is the opposite of ASee AnalysisIrony for other types of irony but lets be clear on what irony is not since that is where the confusion mainly comes from and its misused a lot It is not a lie It is not a joke It is not a coincidence It is not a tragedy It is not merely anything unexpected It is not the same as sarcasmIrony can overlap with those but just by themselves they are not irony This is where the confusion of the meaning of the word usually starts People try to apply it where it doesnt belong Its rather common in fiction for one person to correct another who has incorrectly used the term see Dude Not IronicIt enjoyed a renaissance in the 90s thanks to Postmodernism which is a slightly different concept of irony,1232

Flanderization,By Winston Rowntree of SubnormalityI think Homer gets stupider every year— Professor Lawrence Pierce The Simpsons The Simpsons 138th Episode SpectacularThe act of taking a single often minor action or trait of a character within a work and exaggerating it more and more over time until it completely consumes the character Most always the traitaction becomes completely outlandish and it becomes their defining characteristic turning them into a caricature of their former selves Sitcoms and sitcom characters are particularly susceptible to this as are peripheral characters in shows with long runsThe trope is named for The Simpsons character Ned Flanders who was originally depicted as a friendly generous Christian neighbor and a model father husband and citizen making him a contrast to Homer Simpson As seasons progressed however he became increasingly obsessively religious to the point where he eventually embodied almost every negative stereotype of the Godfearing biblethumping American Christian evangelistNote that the key to this trope is in how the process is a gradual thing the character starts relatively normal with a few quirks the quirks become more prominent then the quirks gradually become the character If the character acquires quirks that are contrary to their earlier portrayal usually because the writers were figuring out what to do with them that is Characterization Marches OnIn general comedies especially sitcoms fall into the trap of Flanderization because Character Development is far less important than Rule of Funny Given a choice between getting a laugh or moving the story forward the former will almost always take priorityFlanderization doesnt have to be a bad thing — sometimes it can be used to expand on a background characters personality when they are brought to the foreground or make an otherwise bland character stand out more It can even be beneficial on a castwide scale A comedy that has a cast full of zany outsized personas will probably be funnier than one full of nondescript straight menWhen Flanderization occurs as the result of adaptation from one medium to another manga to anime for example its Character Exaggeration and frequently a sign of Adaptation Decay May sometimes be related to Lost in ImitationSee also Never Live It Down when the character is more associated with some action or event than the character actually changing Unintentionally Sympathetic when realistic quirks are mishandled by the writers and Forgot Flanders Could Do That when a story brings back preFlanderized aspects of the character as a reminder that those traits are there even if you dont see them much any more Compare Temporarily Exaggerated Trait which is like flanderization but only done temporarily Compare and contrast EarlyInstallment Weirdness as it applies to characters with early depictions of a character being different from later ones simply because the producers hadnt figured out what role they should play in the story See also Moral Disambiguation for when the morality of a work becomes more black and whiteThe opposite to this trope is Character Development naturallyThe Other Wiki has their own article It credits usHeres a list of cases of FlanderizationStupidity A character does dumb things but manages to get gradually dumber as time goes by A character is only slightly dumb and is capable of doing what they need to but later becomes unable to perform even the most simple tasks like reading The characters stupidity is only demonstrated by them saying funny phrases but later starts putting their and others lives at danger Insanity or eccentricity is mistaken for stupidity and a dippy or crazy character becomes a dumb character A character is not dumb just lazy andor hates studying but is turned later into straight dumb Incompetence or clumsiness is mistaken for stupidity and a character whos clumsy or bad at their job becomes a dumb character A character is dimwitted but clearly has good intentions or at the very least isnt a bad person but later becomes actively rude and malicious often using their lack of intelligence to justify any rude or flatout dangerous actionsIntelligence A character is intelligent but in realistic levels later they become extremely intelligent being comparable to many famous scientists or even exaggerated to the point of being able to build wondrous gadgets at their house Insanity or eccentricity is mistaken for brilliance and a dippy or crazy character who would previously save the day through an Ass Pull once in a while for Rule of Funny now does so Once per Episode A character is intelligent in one or two specific areas but more inexperienced and flawed in others Later they are smart in every level providing knowledge and wisdom in every possible situation Knowledge is conflated with intelligence and a character who knows a lot of trivia is turned into a geniusGreed A greedy character has a kind side and

empathizes with those whom the character infuriates The creators find out that a character is very hated and decide to make fun of it making them intentionally annoying however their annoying traits are cranked up andor the character shows up with scrappy traits that they never had or worse turning the character into a villain even if the fans knew the character was not evil The creators discover a character is not well liked by the fans and thus decides to hurt and humiliate the character in increasingly horrifying ways despite the fact that the character had really done nothing wrong in recent episodes A character that is intelligent and sometimes accidentally patronizes or confuses laymen later becomes an Insufferable Genius and may even lose the genius partLikesdislikes A character has a favorite food like many people have but later the love for that food is brought up all the time and the character becomes enamored with it to the point of addiction Conversely if there is a food or something else that the character doesnt like their distaste for it will increase over time and the character will become more and more of a magnet for improbable situations in which the disliked thing cannot be avoided Its also possible for a character to simply be a Big Eater who has their love of food upped over time to the point that they will eat literally anything happily even inorganicinedible items A character has an interest that gradually turns into an obsession A character starts out with a diverse set of interests but gradually becomes only obsessed with one of themSexuality A character is known to be very sexually active or perverted but they can control themselves Maybe theyre an Ethical Slut or Chivalrous Pervert The characters lust and sexual activity

said character may possess other traits but will later become just a walking gay joke or stereotype A character who mightve been pretty cool with some sexualkinky stuff every now and then now cant

Book Dumb,You know how Einstein got bad grades as a kid Well mine are even worse— Calvin Calvin and Hobbes note For the record this is a myth Einstein got excellent grades particularly in math and physics He just didnt get along well with his teachersNot every student will be a certified genius and obsess over anything that isnt a flawless A Many will actually do quite mediocre in school but this is despite seeming at least average in intelligence in most other areas of life This is generally an indication that they arent stupid but dont have the skills to rise next to the TV Genius characters in academia Alternatively they may be Brilliant but Lazy where the lazy part is disliking sucking up to the faculty or is secretly a Genius Ditz when given the right project to work onA Book Dumb character is a fairly common way to incite relatability with the audience especially when creating a This Loser Is You while still allowing them to be special in the scope of being a main character A Book Dumb character will usually show excellent street smarts is quite capable of thinking on their feet and is often very good at problem solving most of the time but he and it is usually a boy does not function well within a regimented learning system Maybe hes just not good at that type of learning Maybe hes clever but cant resist an opportunity for mischief In extreme cases he may even be a genius or inventor at home but devolves into a functionally illiterate bad boy as soon as he enters through the school gates Maybe hes just Too Dumb to Fool or an Apathetic Student Some characters are like this due to literally not having a formal education either due to a familycommunity situation or being from an area without an education infrastructure They might not be in any way stupid or lazy but a lack of opportunity has simply restricted their progressionMore or less the polar opposite of the stereotypical nerd who does excellently in school but is shown as being almost completely incompetent in all other areas of life Both can be very intelligent people but only in certain circumstances The different attitudes of most people to each type of character betray our societys mistrust of intellect Both however can be GeeksThis is also common among adults who will be portrayed as not having done very well at school even though today they may be a wealthy business owner famous novelist celebrated artist top sportsman or nuclear safety inspector If the character is doing a menial labor job they will usually be just as ineffective in his job as he was at school though always managing to avoid George Jetson Job Security while displaying considerable intelligence in other areas of their lifeThis is one of the ways writers have evolved Brains Versus Brawn since this trope allows you to maintain the contrast between the smart and dumb character while also giving the dumb character both more complexity than a onenote idiot character and a leg up in the competition over their smarter foil who often suffers from a lack of Street Smarts Often overlaps with Troubled but Cute especially in Western media Book Dumb female characters are quite common in Anime and Manga but in Western media this trope tends to skew heavily male The popularity of the Uptown Girl trope might also be a factorSome writers will try and use it as a criticism of the school system either claiming that schools are staffed by incompetent idiots who dont know intelligence when they see it or that schools are deliberately designed to stifle innovation and free will in order to turn kids into mindless future wage slavesStill this trope has quite a bit of Truth in Television As any teacher can tell you there is something about the school system that does alienate a certain portion of otherwise intelligent children although the pervasiveness of this trope frustrates some students that are held to Teen Genius standards by their parents wondering why nobody that actually does well in school is ever the main character Most troublingly this trope is popular among antiintellectuals who argue that academic smarts are entirely worthless Of course being antiintellectuals their arguments lack a certain something Luckily some school systems are trying to do things to solve this problem as it often makes learning easier for everybody anyway and several systems have been in use since just after the Turn of the Millennium although widespread adoption has yet to occur anywhere Also most bookdumb people in reallife often resort to looking up the answers to their schoolwork online — typically through the likes of Wikipedia — to put on an intelligent façade in pursuit of popularity or at least not flunk out and get in troubleThe inversion is Book Smart Contrast

Unbuilt Trope,An Unbuilt Trope is when a work makes it seem like a trope is deconstructed Subverted Justified or even Played for Laughs when in reality its the Trope Maker Or at the very least its the work that popularized the trope and the one thats often Misblamed for the current saturated use of the tropePicture the following scenarioBoy Replacement Goldfish is kind of a weird idea isnt it Replacing someone you loved like that always struck you as kind of odd The kind of person who would do that must not be a paragon of mental stabilityBecause the work was the trope maker it could freely explore the ramifications of the trope before it solidified or in some cases congealed into its current form It seems like a deconstruction but at the time there was no trope to deconstruct just an interesting idea to explore it wasnt expected to conform to a certain pattern because the pattern had not yet been established And only with the benefit of hindsight does it comes across as subversive Its like showing a chair to someone who doesnt know a thing about the concept and asking them to describe it without understanding the primary characteristics of what makes a chair a chair they draw from all of their observations like the material its made of or its specific shape — the fact that it makes for a nice sitting apparatus may cross their minds but only as one factor among manyThe trope could have taken on its current form for many reasons the imitators could have been part of the Misaimed Fandom of the work they drew inspiration from they may have consciously decided that the original was unsatisfying and thus needed to be Lighter and Softer or Darker and Edgier later appearances of the trope may have decayed or been Flanderized compared to the original defining appearance they may simply have decided to take what they wanted from the story and calling the original their inspiration caused people to assume the original was similar plotwise or the imitators may not have had the talent required to depict the trope with the same depth that the original author did After all frequently a genius invents the trope and works it out with skill and the hacks come after only able to vaguely copy it or intentionally simplify it to make it easier to work withIt can also go the other way around the original is bland and unappealing even The Lord of the Rings was considered such by some critics when it first came out and the later authors are the ones that constructed the mythos and the popular cliches Alternatively the deconstructed or parodic form of the trope rather than the original became more popular and accepted over the long runRemember that this trope is not about gushing about the original and how the subsequent works dont get the genius It is purely about the source of the conventions in a certain genre Just because a work came early doesnt make it better or more genuine in the same way that sketches are not better than the final work If a work simply is an example of a trope thats more commonly associated with a later more well known work you may be looking for Older Than They Think or UrExample,3124

Hollywood Board Games,This is why Scrabble isnt an EEEEEEEdiots gameIn real life Board Games are a multibillion dollar global industry with thousands of titles released by hundreds of publishers each year In Hollywood thanks to Small Reference Pools and the fact that most tabletop gaming is still viewed as a niche pastime in North America the board gaming industry stopped a few decades ago which is not coincidentally around the time most current Hollywood writers and producers were children Most of the board game industrys global growth in size occurred starting in the mid1990s so it will likely be a while before games like Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride appear regularly in television or film let alone as a prominent character interest in fictionMany board games in media are featured as a means to demonstrate a characters intellect state of mind or general disposition and in these cases it isnt necessarily important what game is being played Showing a novel game unfamiliar to the audience would distract from the purpose of the scene so a game with wide recognition allows for a quick way to demonstrate a character is engaged in some competition of skill andor mind Or on the other hand they could regard board games as Something That Begins with BoringThis is one consequence of Small Reference Pools Compare Fictional Board Game which is when writers decide to make up an original game instead SuperTrope of to Bad Guys Play Pool thanks to billiards association with illegal betting rings Cunning People Play Poker winning at poker requires some measure of mind games Most Common Card Game Go Fish is seen as a card game for kiddies Scrabble Babble showing a character is at their wits end by having them use madeup words in Scrabble and Smart People Play Chess due to the heavy strategizing that takes placeContrast Boggles the Mind when a person playing a word game keeps findingmaking words that fit what theyre thinking about See also Playing Pictionary when people struggle to guess just what a character drew due to how badsimplistic it is Not related but somewhat similar to Game of Nerds which is when the only sport nerdy characters are allowed to like is baseball,2174

Animal Motifs,Who would win in a fight between a blue mongoose and a red snakeAh the Animal Kingdom offers many useful ideas— Dr Otto Octavius The Spectacular SpiderMan The Invisible HandHumans have always been fascinated by animals Love them or hate them they usually provoke a strong reaction in people from the Jerkass who turns to mush when confronted by a playful puppy to the tough guy who freaks out when he encounters something slithery Most mythologies feature animals in starring roles some belief systems feature animals as guides oracles or totems representing certain qualities or certain people So of course animals are going to turn up as symbols in popular mediaThis animal isnt around to be petted or kicked or to assist in taking over the world well it might be but only as a side job The real purpose of these animals is that of most motifs theyre there to underline a theme or make a statement about a certain character They might not even be physically present at all The animal might be the name of a football team a charm on a bracelet or an ornament on the mantelpieceAnimals are used to depict characters more often than they describe themes Even in the real world describing a person by comparing them to an animal is a good way to convey your opinion of them phrases such as lionhearted eagleeyed or doity rat are popular to the point of cliché Therefore many Animal Motifs are also Characterization Tropes The wimp who spends his time watching the tigers at the zoo will most likely be stronger than you think As for the girl doodling big black spiders with suspicious red hourglasses on their underbellies think twice before accepting her invitation to coffeeAnimals like flowers are a motif that tends to be gendered Men are usually compared to animals that are clearly predatory wolves lions and bears for example Women generally get the cute and fluffy animals as motifs such as bunnies However women have historically had a strong association with the cat which while cuddly and furry is also a predator Cats are therefore a common motif for female characters but one aspect of the feline mystique will most likely be emphasized over the others — the woman will either be a predator a seductress or a sweet little kitten Lionesses are especially popular for Action Girls they look very different from male lions and most people know its lionesses who do the hunting so a lioness motif conveniently emphasizes both femininity and ferocity Women are also frequently associated with foxes also a predatory animal although it is the foxs attractive nature or reputation as a trickster that is being invokedSome animals can be used as a motif for either sex but the sex of that character can affect the image of the invoked animal For example horses are usually associated with women or little girls as a reflection of their innocent and supportive side For men and the elderly the horse is a symbol of their virility work ethic and determination Bears are another example If they are a man then they either physically resemble a bear or they are as strong and brutal as one If the motif is given to a woman then they are characterized as sweet and innocent until someone harms or upsets their children whereupon they will bring hell on Earth to protect themThe important thing is that motif should correlate with the character and be displayed appropriately for example a shark motif would indicate the character is either a villain a greedy moneylender or a combative sociopathic antihero Therefore a shark motif wouldnt apply to an altruistic cheerful paragon who favors clemency over brutality note Since in reality sharks killing humans are extremely rare it is entirely possible to apply tropes like Not Evil Just Misunderstood here or Does Not Know His Own Strength since many attacks are merely test bites where the shark is not attempting to eat the target only to figure out what it is not having hands and all Many sharks pose no risk at all to humans including the largest sharks like the whale shark However given the commonness of Threatening Shark as a trope this would be a subversion like the opposite of Devious Dolphins The motif must make sense to the character and allow the audience to understand the story you want to tell if you use the wrong motif for the character then the audience wont know who to root for in the storyIn the world of fiction someone who doesnt like animals at all is either a nasty piece of work or obsessively clean and germphobic Animal hater is the word for them and so to dilute the hardheartedness of this character expect to see one particular animal that they just cant resistnoteFor some reason this animal has a tendency to be catsAnd if the character themself is an animal then there might be the possibility that they have yet another animal that also represents them,4838

Nothing Personal,Pulling nothing personal on The Punisher and Eminem Thats asking for troubleTom Hagen Your father wouldnt want to hear this Sonny This is business not personal Santino Corleone They shoot my father and its business my ass Tom Hagen Even shooting your father was business not personal Sonny— The GodfatherA longstanding Stock Phrase that has two usesThe first is usually used by a villain Generally it will be given after the villain has announced what they are about to do but before they actually do it Alternatively it may be given after the hero has overwhelmed the villain and the villain is trying to defuse the heros anger or justify their actions It wasnt personal after all This can also come in the form of its not personalOften used this way by the Lovable Traitor and the PunchClock Villain Often this phrase comes back around in the form of an Ironic Echo A protagonist who Stumbled Into the Plot might hear this by the antagonist trying to clean up loose ends ie kill any witnessesUsually when a person says this it really isnt personal to them Normally this is said so that the person theyre talking to knows that theyre Just Following Orders and arent killing them because of a grudge or something However one can also argue that saying it isnt personal makes it personal as it means the victim doesnt matter to the speaker If anything it often makes it worse because it usually means the victim didnt even do anything to even remotely justify the pain they have been forced to go through As such this trope can also refer to the character himself and not just to dialogue At other times the antagonist may say its not personal as a way of saying no hard feelingsThere are quite a few times when someone usually the hero starts off this way and honestly means it however as the conflict progresses he starts to get genuinely angry at whoever it is usually because the guy is doing things that disgust him or because the villain started choosing victims who were close to the hero at which point he changes his mind and says All right now Its PersonalOften punctuated with Just Following Orders Contrast Its Personal See also Being Personal Isnt Professional and Consummate ProfessionalUnfortunately this trope is very much Truth in Television,2257
Trope Namers,Hello My Name Is Inigo Montoya You Killed My Father Prepare to Die— Inigo Montoya The Princess BrideVarious works are popular or influential when it comes to tropes One measure is how readily we name tropes from these worksThis should not be done lightly and is not a badge of honor Using trope namers lightly or as a badge of honor is TropeNamer Syndrome and leads to confusion renaming and possible deletion of tropesA series usually gets to name a trope if its so widely known for the trope even outside the circle of nerds its basically an icon of it or if it has a term for the situation that is simply Made of Win Or if it happens to be the Trope Maker too Of course since Most Tropers Are Young Nerds we do kinda swing closer to the geek side of things But whaddaya expect This is the Internet after allAlso we at TV Tropes dont want tropes named directly after a trope namer since thetrope namer may always get its own page If they are the Trope Namer the trope name should reflect the difference for example RashomonStyle This is doubly true for characters who must embody the trope so well that one could point to them and say Yeah kinda like him and other tropers will immediately agree without having to consult Google in the process Even so there is no guarantee that even the Trope Namer will always actually be an example of the same tropeKeep in mind however that calling a work the Trope Namer in the initial TLP writeup simply because you took the preliminary title from it especially if you are naming the trope after a character is very presumptuous chances are high that the troper Hive Mind will disagree about whether or not the work is widely known enough to qualify Of course such trope proposals arent technically named yet the title may be subject to change in TLP if someone else comes up with a better title For the purpose of actually finding a better title see Naming a TropeSee also Image Source a listing of the various works and sometimes real life which the various trope page images are derived from Quote Source is the page quote equivalentWorks and creators that have inspired trope names are listed in the subpages linked

Lampshade Hanging,The Order of the Stick hangs a lampshade on Lampshade Hanging with a literal lampshadeSir Toby Belch Is it possible Fabian If this were played upon a stage now I could condemn it as an improbable fiction— Shakespeare Twelfth Night Act 3 Scene IVLampshade Hanging or more informally Lampshading is the writers trick of dealing with any element of the story that seems too dubious to take at face value whether a very implausible plot development or a particularly blatant use of a trope by calling attention to it and simply moving onThis assures the audience that the author is aware of the implausible plot development that just happened and that they arent trying to slip something past the audience It also assures the audience that the world of the story is like Real Life whats implausible for you is just as implausible for these characters and just as likely to provoke an incredulous responseThe creators are using the tactic of selfdeprecatingly pointing out their own flaws themselves thus depriving critics and opponents of their ammunition The Turkey City Lexicon refers to this flavor of Lampshade Hanging as a Signal from Freud and reminds the author that if your characters are complaining about how stupid the latest plot development is maybe your subconscious is trying to tell you somethingOn the other hand Lampshade Hanging done well can make for an entertaining piece of Medium Awareness or momentary lack of Genre Blindness It can also be used to take care of Fridge Logic without having to actually do anything For this reason it can be seen either as making a bad movie even worse or as adding clever writing and humourThis practice is also known as hanging a clock on it hanging a lantern on it or spotlighting it In the film industry its sometimes called hanging a red flag on something after the screenwriting adage To hang a red flag on something takes the curse off of it meaning that to lampshade something decreases the negative effects it might otherwise have Teodolinda Barolini referred to this as the Geryon Principle in reference to how Dante narrates how unbelievable his true story is the more fantastical it gets We went with our title because its the one used in the Mutant Enemy bullpenCan also be combined with a Hand Wave sometimes invoking an unreveal to make explaining a plot inconsistency unnecessary When breaking internal consistency is deliberate this trope can be used to show that yes it is deliberate instead of a plot hole Can also be combined with an active attempt to avoid the trope in which case the Lampshade Hanging turns into a Defied TropeCommonly seen in the selfaware shows that make up the Deconstructor Fleet rarely used in the presence of a DropIn Character If large numbers of lampshades are hung then the writers believe lampshades are Better than a Bare Bulb this tropes Logical ExtremeAt times you may even just have a Puff of Logic because of thisHypocrisy Nod and Inspiration Nod are specific types of this Meta Guy is the fellow who does this all the time Sometimes takes the form of This Is the Part Where Compare Discussed Trope Postmodernism and Playing with a Trope No Fourth Wall happens when characters discuss not only tropes but the writers as wellNot to be confused with Lampshade WearingOnce again Lampshade Hanging is when attention is drawn to something that is so strange it threatens to break the Willing Suspension of Disbelief Leaning on the Fourth Wall is for things which make sense in the story but also have a second meaning outside of the story Try not to get these confused,3569

Cryptid Episode,He also met a big foot◊ once but thats another storyA cryptid is an animal which is not yet known to modern science such as Bigfoot The Mothman or the Loch Ness Monster Sometimes a show that is not usually focused on them will have an episode or two about themThis type of episode can be used as a characterisation exercise establishing some of the characters as believers and others as skepticsPossible plots for this kind of episode include The characters spend the episode trying to find the cryptid In a Slice of Life series they generally dont succeed conclude that it must not exist and go home Sometimes it will be revealed to the audience that the creature is Real After All but the characters discovering a cryptid could permanently change their lives forever and thats BAD The characters find a cryptid early in the episode and spend the episode trying to look after ithide ithelp it find its way home Characters are traveling on holiday and encounter one Abominable Snowman seems to be the most common one for this what with mountain getaways and Christmas Episodes providing plenty of snowy settings A show with a Monster of the Week format will have a cryptid as one of said monsters A crime show may come across a murder or other crime allegedly committed by a cryptid The characters usually find out that theres a more reasonable explanation but the end of the episode may reveal the creature is Real After AllIf done clumsily this can easily result in a Bizarro Episode See also Our Cryptids Are More Mysterious and Alien Episode,1545
Captain Oblivious,There are of course obvious limitations to not understanding the role of money in the lives of the majority The late president John F Kennedy was aware of this limitation and he was forever asking his working friends how much they made On occasion he was at a disadvantage because he did not understand the traders mentality He missed the point with Khrushchev at Vienna His father an old hand at Hollywood would have better understood the moguls bluffing— Gore Vidal The Holy FamilySome characters are so completely insulated from the outside world that life for them is very different from life for others This is extreme to the point that they literally have difficulty comprehending that life could be different for other people and will work their everyday lives under the assumption that all people view life through the same lens that they doThey can be given a rather rude awakening when for one reason or another a different character acts in such a way that the guy living in a bubble realizes that the world is a very very different place from what he thought it was Up until that point they will always Fail A Spot Check if anything happens that conflicts with their worldviewOften a good way to frame a Reasonable Authority Figure The main reason they havent acted so far is largely that they didnt realize what was going onIn terms of logic this thinking involves the common fallacy of Confirmation Bias sometimes with a dash of No True Scotsman Compare Opinion MyopiaSee also I Thought Everyone Could Do That This is the supertrope to Rich in Dollars Poor in Sense A variation on No Social Skills When the character is only blind in one area thats Selective ObliviousnessNot to be confused with Inspector Oblivious or Captain Obvious,1748

Bully Brutality,Bully or aspiring serial killerOften in media The Bully is portrayed as a typical Jerkass whose biggest threat to their victim is a wedgie or fist in the face Aside from that they are mostly harmless in the grand scheme of things Bully Brutality takes the typical bully up to eleven by having him do things that could actually seriously hurt or even kill their victim though the bully may or may not actually want to commit murder Of course knowingly using violence that can result in serious injury or death isnt any better than premeditated murder Where the typical bully just wants to give their victim a black eye the brutal bully wants to beat them to a bloody pulp if not even worse The fact that the bully is capable of inflicting such harm is usually lampshaded by the characters It becomes clear that these bullies have no limits It also becomes clear that because of that they have crossed all lines which makes it a great example of crossing the Moral Event HorizonDo not confuse this with cases where bullying has led to the victim committing suicide thats just a specific case of Driven to Suicide This trope is where the bullying itself has reached levels where the bully has committed manslaughter or come close to it by landing the victim in hospital or leaving them permanently disabledRelated to Kids Are Cruel Teens Are Monsters and Bullied into Depression Compare NoHoldsBarred Beatdown a common weapon in the bullys arsenal for this trope Contrast with School Bullying Is Harmless Sadly this is Truth in Television some Real Life bulles have been known to brutally beat maim disable or even kill their victims That being said No Real Life Examples PleaseSee also Barbaric Bully for more unrealistic and stereotypical portrayals of brutal bullies,1766

TV Genius,In TV land it seems intelligence isnt just a matter of being able to learn more quickly reason better and understand more easily The TV Genius is what you get when intelligent characters conform to an unintelligent persons idea of how an intelligent person acts A TV Genius has an impossibly or immeasurably high IQ never uses a short word when a sententious alternative might elicit advantageous conversation and has the full package of exaggerated traits and strange behaviors Hollywoodland associates with big brains This is especially obvious when the lead character is a normal person clever enough but no rocket scientist with the tradeoff of better looks and more social competenceAlthough intellectuals often do have interest in obscure topics the TV Genius is inexplicably baffled that other people have different interests than theirs Their only pastimes will be reading thick tomes and playing chess They will frequently rattle off statistics and calculations to implausible degrees of precision These may be relevant to the plot at hand but not their assumed field of study statistics and math articles are like Playboy magazines to these folksIn social situations a TV Genius will come across like a human robot their brain is so filled with jargon and minutiae that it leaves no room for interpersonal skills and social graces either they have no idea how to communicate their thoughts without seeming blunt and insensitive or they carry themselves with a sort of overbearing arrogance that comes from remaining emotionally detached and logicalminded in contrast to their sentimental colleagues a la The Spock and can expect to be the token Vulcan of a team Their lack of social skills is also likely to make them a Celibate Eccentric GeniusIf a character becomes smarter for instance through a Genius Serum theyll instantly acquire all sorts of knowledge that they never actually learned at any point Someone who becomes suddenly smarter may also suddenly acquire a lab coat and Nerd Glasses and start speaking like Mr Spock though this is usually limited to the more comedic examples In cartoons this will often be visualized as a swollen head as if their brain is literally growing as it gets smarter They may learn to appreciate their normalness from the inner unhappiness that comes from being too smart for ones own goodTheres also a chance that the TV Genius will be used in An Aesop about respecting nonintellectuals and appreciating the hard work they put into being the best and the brightest via an encounter with someone with a learning disorder that locks them out of the genius stratumThe Teen Genius the Mad Scientist The Professor and the AbsentMinded Professor all contain aspects of thisSee also Science Is Bad Dumb Is

obscure trivia and unashamed intellectual Bartlet was also a genuinely caring personable and likable man with a great deal of charm He was after all able to get himself elected twice to the office of President of the United States which requires some people skills Largely deconstructed and averted in Fringe with the Bishops Walter Bishop can come off this way but hes actually a severely damaged man from being wrongly committed to a mental institution for 17 years not entirely from his genius Peter Bishop Walters son sort of is about as intelligent and inventive as his father but is much more sociallyadept Showcased by  Walternate Walters alternateuniverse counterpart never committed to a mental institution and instead becoming Secretary of Defense He is a stern ruthless pragmatic man who commands respect Similarly William Bell Walters old partner is charismatic and charming funnily enough being played by Leonard Nimoy The Red Dwarf episode Holoship involves a whole shipload of these plus Rimmer becoming the most alarmingly extreme example The Mad Scientist electronics designing genius who escaped from the CIA in the first season of Chuck We dont get to see him when hes on his meds but when hes off them hes quite dangerous Also kinda twitchy Good at manipulating people Or at least Chuck An episode of Burn Notice gives us a delusional genius Hes really good at seeing patterns deduces that the hero is a spy has discovered that a traitor is selling secrets and getting American soldiersspies killed Also he warns the good guys to be careful because That bitch is an alien Shes probably not an alien Criminal Minds Reid takes this to a whole new level being a culmination of literally everything without exception in the description for this trope  right down to the vague Star Trek reference Its even implied in the show that he might have a form of autism He once showed up at a convention dressed as The 4th Doctor and is seen trying to talk to Morgan about the logistics of the Death Star both shows being examples of nerdy interests To a large degree Reids former father figure Jason Gideon counts since hes incredibly gifted and not just in profiling techniques but hes also very quirky neurotic and asocial Much of it may stem from his work as a criminal profiler which has left him traumatized In the end he retires to live in a remote cabin it was also too much for Mandy Patinkin since he found the shows content disturbing and quit so the character quitting was then written in Charlie began exhibiting traits of one on Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia after taking pills that supposedly increase his intelligence It turns out the pills were actually just Placebos and his heightened intelligence was just an extreme level of misplaced arrogance The most of main characters in Scorpion qualify They have a team member who is specifically brought along to help them interact with people Walter uses Spock Speak and is the most stereotypical intellectual nerd He even claims to not feel emotion which later turns into I have trouble expressing emotion Sylvester probably has the highest Emotional Quotient on the team which would make him more personable if it werent for his crippling fears and tendency to fanboy over games tabletop or most prominently his favorite comicbook character Super Fun Guy Toby constantly mocks others and has a narcissism problem Happy is constantly illtempered as a defense mechanism but shes a Jerk with a Heart of Gold Doctor Who Deconstructed a little bit with companion Zoe She at first appears to be one of these in The Wheel in Space but we learn that shes actually had some sort of brainwashing in order to turn her into a librarian with perfect recall for facts and computerlike logic Her coworkers treat her with anything from suspicion to mockery with some regarding her as more like an object than a person because of this Zoes reason for joining the Doctor is because she wants to reconnect with her own emotions In the Second Doctor serial Tomb of the Cybermen Klieg and Kaftan are highups in the Brotherhood of Logicians a group that boasts of its mass intelligence Sadly it seems it doesnt instruct its members in such concepts as Evil Is Not a Toy or Know When to Fold Em The Doctor himself is impossibly smart note  granted hes an alien who was considered Brilliant but Lazy by his kind arrogant and butts heads with nonintellectual types Across the years hes played to such smart guy stereotypes as Mad Scientist AbsentMinded Professor Gadgeteer Genius Starving Artist Hot Teacher and Misfit Lab Rat some of them in the same incarnation    Newspaper Comics  Jason from FoxTrot Hes extremely skilled when it comes to mathematics science and computers but utterly lacking in common sense and scruples Hence we see him building inadvisable Bamboo Technology such as a catapult to launch himself to frighten his sister using his Playful Hacker talents to spread devastating computer viruses at least one of which seemed to have no purpose other than to protest that he didnt have a crush on a girl in his class and doing his Book Dumb siblings homework in exchange for money but often giving them the wrong answers His lack of common sense makes some sense as he is only 10 years old and raised in a house with a father and brother who also lack common sense Also it is notable that the author probably had far more experience with booksmart science nerds than your average nonscifi writer as he did complete his bachelors degree in physics at Amherst College    Video Games  Most if not all of the nerd clique in Bully Naturally in a place like Bullworth Academy theyre at the bottom of the social ladder and prime targets for the bullies and jocks there In The Dig Brink becomes something of a TV Genius after his resurrection You can blame the Green Rocks for that though Aversion by Professor Solus in Mass Effect 2 as his high level of intelligence instead makes him an incredibly practical man in terms of doing what has to be done Yet his speech is a bit unusual leaving out most filler words for expediency Example Lots of ways to help people Sometimes heal patients sometimes execute dangerous people Either way helps Many of his odd behaviours may have more to do with his culture and species All of his species think speak and act exhaustingly quickly he just expediates his actions even more so Mordin is also old by salarian standards their lifespan is about 40 and hes 44 when you recruit him In StarCraft IIs cinematics the scientists seem incapable of using normalsized words jump to conclusions in a very unscientific way and wear lab coats and nerd glasses or goggles all the time Almost every Mad Scientist character in the Crash Bandicoot series represents this most especially Dr Neo Cortex due to having fantastical scientific achievements in spite of being a Cloud Cuckoo Lander and a egomaniacal Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain Surprisingly Crashs sister Coco averts this While she is a technical genius and mildly bratty and eccentric she tends to keep her ego and social skills checked otherwise acting like a standard happygolucky little girl with a bit of Big Brother Worship towards ditzy Crash    Webcomics  Jasper Zinc fits the trope although its not that he is a TV Genius so much as hes obsessed with making sure everyone around him knows hes a genius period So he deliberately avoids using contractions and adopts a highfalutin fauxeducated manner of speech so that its absolutely clear even to the lowest common denominator that this is an intellect you dont mess with He doesnt appear to have thought it through though as people too far above said lowest common denominator tend not to be impressed While there are plenty of smart people in The Inexplicable Adventures Of Bob Galatea fits the trope best because her selfimage is so wrapped up in her own opinion of her intellect Shes pedantic pompous and contemptuous of popular or lowbrow culture as well as being a Gadgeteer Genius and Omnidisciplinary Scientist Contrasting with the trope though she does appear to be the only member of the cast who has any sense of fashion about how she dresses Her sister Molly is just as smart but much more friendly and grounded and has a much broader array of interests    Web Original  Largely averted in the Whateley Universe where the teen inventors tend to come across as realistic teenaged nerds The trope best fits rich kid Ayla Goodkind Phase who has spent his whole life up to his current age of fifteen preparing to be a tycoon in the family business He knows tons of useless facts and knows more about finance than any adult ought to He speaks in a pompous manner with lots of long words He took a special literature course on epics just for fun even though the class had to read about fifteen or twenty epics in a single term and he did so well that he ended up writing several journal articles with the class lecturer Daniel OBrien of Crackedcom is this in After Hours able to fill in blanks and cite statistics due in part to being compulsive and socially inept    Western Animation  In an episode of Aladdin The Series Aladdins head was separated from his body The head containing the brain suddenly became a TV Genius and was able to spout scientific knowledge that no one in this period barring perhaps genies should have access to such as how nerves work Aladdins headless body containing his good heart became an embodiment of Dumb Is Good whereas the head turned into an Anvilicious Straw Vulcan Ben 10 Ben 10 has a morph Grey Matter that greatly increases his intelligence As Grey Matter Ben knows a lot of information that he couldnt possibly know speaks in unnecessarily long words unlike his usual typical tenyearold method of speech and appears to lose common sense and the ability to talk to normal people when asked where are you he begins to give information that could find his geographical position such where he is in reference to a mountain until prompted for the name of a street Ben 10 Alien Force has an arguably more straight example in Brainstorm While Grey Matter knows more and speaks longer the Ben personality doesnt change as shown when Ben says How do I know thatI have no idea what Im talking about Brainstorm adapts a British accent uses words simply because they are longer and not because they have any scientific value at hand and becomes much more arrogant in how smart he is In Ben 10 Omniverse its discovered that the two species the Galvans Grey Matter and the Cerebrocrustacians Brainstorm are in a bit of a galactic contest to see which species is smarter Well the Cerebrocrustations are at least The Galvans tend to just ignore the boasting and bragging the Cerebrocristations do so it would appear that how Ben acts as each alien matches how the aliens themselves act Galvans are downtobusiness Cerebrocrustations are vain and boastful The eponymous character of Dexters Laboratory hes a world renowned genius capable of building time machines giant robots and create all sort of genetically modified creatures yet thinks girl is some kind of tribe doesnt know what dirt is and one time thought he was going to die due to having gas Justified as genius or not hes still a little boy Averted in an episode of Doug Skeeter whod always been the goofy sidekick type takes an IQ test and scores incredibly high Over the course of the episode he is studied by scientists and gets into college from the elementaryschool setting of the series This revelation goes largely ignored in most later Nickelodeon episodes the Disney series has Skeeters genius IQ play a role in a few other plots However at no point in either series does his personality change from The Ditz Family Guy does this with Lauren Conrad The 1960era Felix the Cat show often paired him with the Professors nephew Poindexter hey the name alone who speaks in a stiff formal cadence and wears a lab coat big glasses no eyes visible even a mortarboard hat The title character of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is an elementary school student who is not only excessively prone to Techno Babble and Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness but has invented time travel fasterthanlight warp engines and the best candy in the history of all existence and everything Also he has a giant head An episode of Kim Possible featured a beam capable of drastically increasing ones intelligence which in this case was used on Rufus a naked mole rat propelling his intelligence to superhuman levels Rufus suddenly gained enormous amounts of incredibly complicated knowledge and inventing skills even putting the shows resident Teen Genius Wade to shame There was something about copying the brainwaves of the worlds most brilliant minds as well which just further confuses the matter The concept was that a scientist had decided one night when all his other scientist friends were over to make copies of their minds which could be imprinted on someone by a machine It wasnt that his intelligence was augmented but that he had the combined knowledge of all those scientists It was more that Wade was competing against several people in one body rather than one super smart individual Brainiac 5 from Legion of SuperHeroes animated series seems to use this persona to hide his true emotions Which seem to involve a lot of Superman and wanting To Become Human The Simpsons Martin Prince Another episode had Homer gaining a geniuslevel IQ eventually revealed to be 105 which is completely average in reality but apparently very smart for a character in The Simpsons an increase of 50 points after the removal of a crayon lodged in his brain It also affected his already poor social skills at least the ones that were actually endearing Mostly averted with Lisa — while she sometimes has problems with Intelligence Equals Isolation shes actually one of the most welladjusted characters on the show Her level of knowledge is totally implausible for an eightyearold but it depends entirely on Rule of Funny Lisa does at very least have Insufferable Genius qualities and on occasion is rather blindly obnoxious and self serving in her ethics to the point of being a Soapbox Sadie She also has some obvious childlike follies on occasion These flaws obviously became less significant as the rest of the cast was Flanderized excessively but her shortcomings still show on occasion Brainy Smurf from The Smurfs with his Nerd Glasses and library full of selfwritten books is arrogant and condescending always ready to boast about his vast intellect while being a topnotch KnowNothing KnowItAll and generally useless Though it may be important to note that in the original Belgian comics Brainy Smurf was called Schtroumpf à lunette Smurf with glasses and he wasnt especially smart just extremely pedantic Patrick of SpongeBob SquarePants was once made smart for an episode but he voluntarily returned to stupidity after he realized he was turning into an Insufferable Genius and growing apart from SpongeBob Similarly subverted with Richie of Static Shock After he gains SuperIntelligence he doesnt really act any differently from how he did before He becomes much more invested in building various gadgets but even that behavior was present since the beginning of the series The Superhero Squad Show episode Hulk Talk Smack featured the Hulk being smartinized by the shows MacGuffin In addition to his skin turning grey a Continuity Nod to the comics he starts dressing well and speaking eloquently He also becomes an insufferable jerk and cant seem to hold his own in a fight anymore Rebecca Cunningham of TaleSpin has an MBA and is refined in terms of social inequity however her temperament and stubbornness often lead to unpleasant situations and she often shows an extreme naivete in terms of the outside world providing good contrast to the extremely Book Dumb but streetwise Baloo While she managed to bring Baloos cargo service back from deaths door in terms of business arrangements her attempts to actually fly a plane were somewhat disastrous to say the least Total Drama Pahkitew Island introduces Scarlett a braniac whose dialogue mostly consists of sharing obscure scientific trivia and using complicated language that confuses her teammates Shes also able to quickly understand and alter any computerized device However her character is complicated in Scarlett Fever when it turns out shes an Evil Genius and her quiet intelligent persona is a front to some degree In The Transformers Grimlock gets an IQ boost after chewing into a supercomputer Not only does it boost his intellect it makes his speech far more intelligible to the point of snooty He becomes the goto guy for the Autobots problems but the rest of the Dinobots dont think hes fun anymore This leads to Grimlock creating the Technobots Individually only Nosecone and Lightspeed to a lesser extent fits this trope but Computron their combined form who absorbs Grimlocks advanced intelligence definitely does One episode of CatDog has Dog becoming a genius while Cat grows exponentially stupid Gretchen on Recess fits this trope to a T ten years old yet an improbably brilliant polymath with extraordinary science and engineering skills knowledge of history literature and mathematics And yes susceptible to overwrought verbiage Surprisingly though shes not that socially awkward though her friends express wariness at her nerdier activities Defied with Dipper Pines from Gravity Falls This reddit post by Alex Hirsch states that while Dipper is better academically than his sister Mabel hes still pretty sociable Edd Double D from Ed Edd n Eddy is highly intelligent loves to use big words and the other characters will often see him as an Insufferable Genius But he also shows a lot of common sense even if he cant understand that other people maybe arent as interested in reading books and getting knowledge as he isImportant LinksAdvertisementTVTropes is licensed under a Creative Commons

Freudian Excuse,Lets just say you should take this one with a grain of saltI always wanted a fire truck when I was little I never got one Thats why Im evil heheheheheh— Zorak Cartoon PlanetThe writers have a villain and they want to give that character some depth The obvious solution is to Pet the Dog Unfortunately that tends to make the character less scary causing Badass Decay and Villain DecayInstead writers may keep the villain especially The Sociopath just as vile as before but reveal that they have a reason for being that way The most popular one is the Freudian Excuse the villain had an abusive and particularly violent backstory such as Abusive Parents being bullied by peers being raped in the past etc making them insane and warping their perception on the universe and thats why theyre sociopathic Serial Killers going on a Roaring Rampage of Revenge or why they want to destroy everything out of their misery or why theyre Straw Nihilists who adhere to The Social Darwinist philosophy that its a Crapsack World where Might Makes Right Sometimes this is done for deliberate Badass Decay but usually it isnt The villain is as horrible as ever only now the audience can look at them in a new wayUnfortunately just like a Pet the Dog moment the Freudian Excuse sometimes fails to give a villain any depth at all If the villain is particularly evil it can come across as an illogical and lame Non Sequitur his father beat him and thats why hes an Omnicidal Maniac Even if the villains crimes are proportionate the writers have to strike a hard balance Too much emphasis on the excuse and it looks like theyre attorneys justifying the villain Too little and it is a fallacious Appeal to Pity that looks like a ridiculously gratuitous scene of Wangst However this can in turn be highlighted instory if the other characters point out that Freudian Excuse Is No Excuse In the case of the Complete Monster it fails to justify anything merely explaining their origins and nothing more It could even be used to make the character worse since they know how awful it is to be treated horribly yet inflict pain on others anyway while rejecting the possibility of ever getting over their trauma and changing their waysMost importantly the Freudian Excuse does not involve the character growing or changing it explains why they havent changed and in fact often serves as a signal that they cannot and never will Bad writers often think that the excuse can substitute for Character Development but it does the exact opposite Good writers know the excuse has limits and watch them If done well enough it may lead the audience to Cry for the Devil or even straightup turn a nearComplete Monster into a Woobie Destroyer of Worlds A Freudian Excuse is often invoked to explain how someone who Used to Be a Sweet Kid became such a monster instead  again much writerly skill is generally needed to pull this off and make it poignant rather than patheticThe excuse can be played with in many ways One way is to use it to show how pathetic a villain is — after the villain gives a Breaking Speech a heros classic rebuttal is says the guy who became an Evil Overlord to work out his daddy issues The second way is for the villain to sneer at the heros pity for them even exploiting it in a fight Further the villain is protesting far too much A third way is to simply present it as an explanation rather than a full excuse Sometimes the author simply shows what warped the character into what they became without expecting the audience to feel any more sympathetic toward the character a sort of psychological How We Got Here And a fourth way is to use the Freudian Excuse as a justification for a HeelFace Turn if the villain gets treatment he no longer has any reason to be evil and may pay the heroes back out of gratitudeMany Crime and Punishment Series and Darker and Edgier superhero comics are notorious for Writer on Board stories deconstructing the Freudian Excuse At least once per storyline there will be a slimy psychiatrist or defense attorney who declares that the NeckChopping Killer is merely a victim of circumstances and its the hero who should be locked away These stories tend to end with said psychiatrist or defense attorney getting murdered by the killer which is depicted as poetic IronyHowever not all examples of Freudian Excuses have to involve evil or villainous characters It can also be used to explain the neurotic behaviors of even heroic or otherwise neutral characters And sometimes the Freudian Excuse can work well in sympathizing with a characterSee Freudian Excuse Is No Excuse for deconstructions of this trope and Freudian Excuse Denial for one particular subversion See also Dark and Troubled Past Start of Darkness Jerkass Woobie

Contrast Upbringing Makes the HeroNot to Be Confused with Freud Was Right All Psychology Is Freudian or any of the other five or so Tropes that Sigmund Freud was the Trope Namer for actuallyPlease note that the trope deals only with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence Being raped or losing ones job or family as a fully formed adult is not a Freudian Excuse,5517
The Chew Toy,Chuck just cant catch a breakWhy universe hate Waspinator— Waspinator Beast Wars bemoaning his habit of being blown up Once per EpisodeAn odd sort of polar opposite to The Woobie The Chew Toy is a character the audience loves specifically because their misery amuses them so The Chew Toy is roughed up or messed with on a constant basis and is always always used for comic effect and treated with a light touch generally glossing over the meaner undertones of the ideaWhatever the reason is these characters just cant catch a break Did they do something wrong in a previous life This life Or are they just Innocent Bystanders who look as if theyd blow up in a more amusing manner than anyone else in the crowd Who knows Either way the powers that be tend to inflict punishment on them for seemingly no reason generally but not always of the slapstick physical varietyUnlike Woobification Chew Toys are generally designated as such in the series proper and often have a tendency to bemoan their fate If theyre lucky the writers will Throw the Dog a Bone a time or two If theyre unlucky theyll Yank the Dogs Chain It can sometimes be a delicate balance Throw too often and the character can be Flanderized into The Eeyore Yank too much and the audience may no longer find it funny The latter will happen mostly if the character is both deliberately and unfairly mistreated by other charactersCompare ButtMonkey a character who is mistreated regardless of audience opinion The Eeyore whose depression is usually in excess of their actual mistreatment and Iron ButtMonkey who seems to suffer injury and accidents more frequently than anyone should but is capable of taking it Contrast The Woobie whose suffering inspires sympathy and a desire to make things better for them instead of amusementnote Which category a certain character fits in may vary from person to person The polar opposite is Karma Houdini where characters do horrible things while karma and occasionally the other characters sits back watches and eats popcorn Villains and Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonists though do make good Chew Toys as they bring the bad stuff on themselves Also by making it a selfinflicted role most often because of a characters stupidity and shortsightedness it also makes the torment more palatableIf the entire cast is made up of Chew Toys of some kind or another then youre probably watching a Sadist Show Compare Humiliation CongaNo Real Life Examples Please While life can certainly suck at times nobody exists solely to suffer Also while someones suffering may be funny in fiction thats not that case for Real Life thus there are no examples to be found,2652

Broken Aesop,You cant have an antigun message when you clearly used guns to solve your problem IT JUST DOESNT WORK— Linkara reviewing Superman At Earths EndMost children are familiar with the line Do as I say not as I do A Broken Aesop is this in aesop formBasically a Broken Aesop is a story where a moral presented just doesnt match the original moral that the story actually contained Sometimes the resulting moral feels tacked on or just plain hypocriticalCommon methods of breaking An Aesop include Non Sequiturs Having the resolution rely on a Deus ex Machina Space Whale Aesop or Karmic Twist Ending as opposed to the logical consequences of the lesson Not practicing what you preach The characters tell other characters andor the audience not to do something while doing it themselves Commonly in RPGs and Westerns a Thou Shalt Not Kill Aesop is followed by the next major battle having the characters kill something Characters preach a strict antigun or antiviolence message while using guns andor violence to solve their problems Characters learn not to do something but go back to doing it in later instalments Inconsistently applied morals Distorting the moral into Its only wrong if someone else does it or only if the bad guys do it The character learns a lesson about how the thing he desires so much is not worth it sometimes sacrificing what he wants for the right thing to do but in the end he gets what he wanted anyway This is only true if the lesson was specifically about rejecting said thing A character whos being put through unwarranted cruelty or annoyance by the supposed heroes of the work is punished for standing up for themselves even if they had to resort to more direct methods only to try to stop the other characters from ruining their day yet again Its okay to make someones life hell but its not okay if they give their tormentor a taste of their own medicine because because the writers said so thats why Trying to prove that everybody matters but only once they achieve something which proves their value So still only skilled or famous people are important they just act in an alternative way Fallacious aesops Trying to teach Be Careful What You Wish For by using a Literal or Jackass Genie who never actually gave you what you wished for Saying anyone can do anything they set their mind to by their own resolve when the character was born into royalty or privilege born with some sort of superior genetic power is just plain talented at what they do has the Powers That Be on their side or otherwise revealed to be from a powerful significant bloodline or background explaining their greatness Learning that you shouldnt be sorry for something that wasnt really your fault when it was or learning that you should take responsibilities and accept that it was your fault when it wasnt Learning about the folly of Revenge in a story where everyone the character wanted vengeance on gets punished or killed for their actions anyway Trying to teach a Prejudice Aesop when the prejudice is actually based on a rational fear eg a mouse afraid of cats is seen as prejudiced when most of the group being discriminated against are obnoxious or scary just not this one particular one common in My Species Doth Protest Too Much situations or when another group usually the ones being prejudiced are portrayed as universally reprehensiblebigoted since the existence of such a group would actually make prejudice logical under certain circumstancesNot to be confused with a Hard Truth Aesop where the lesson is supported by the work but its something that parents probably wouldnt want their kids to learn Also not to be confused with a Space Whale Aesop wherethe lesson has no application outside of its fictional context though the two can overlap Compare Analogy Backfire which is when an analogy which may or may not contain an Aesop makes a point that is the opposite of what it was supposed to Do Not Do This Cool Thing is when the Aesop of this thing is bad fails due to clumsy presentation See also Values Dissonance For intentional Broken Aesops Played for Laughs see Spoof AesopImportant Note as tempting it may be please do not add metafictional examples while they may be a Clueless Aesop they constitute an Ad Hominem argument Only add examples where the aesop is broken within the narrative itself This means do not add examples such as How many trees got cut down to produce that book warning us about deforestation How much money did that film with the message against being greedy or about money not being everything or the anticapitalist message gross at the box office How great looking were the actors in that work telling us that looks arent everything or that its whats on the inside that counts How much does the creator for that work with that Snicket Warning Label spend on advertising the work Why is a television showvideo game giving An Aesop about how people need to watch less TVspend less time playing

Celebrity Is Overrated Why is this producer who was criticized for not paying their employees enough to even afford their rent telling me I should treat my employees decently Why is this childrens book arguing that political activism shouldnt be targeted towards kids when the book itself has a political messageAnother thing to note is that an author cannot directly invoke this trope The whole point is that its unintentional The only way to directly invoke this is through other characters criticizing it via Breaking the Fourth Wall or a Show Within a Show formatExamples Anime  Manga Naruto

commercial for CougarLifecom shows one such cougar walking around a bar asserting the superiority of older women over younger women She demonstrates how much more mature and confident she is by bullying and assaulting the younger women in the bar who are already on dates so she can take their place While being condescending to twentysomethings about their parttime jobs and shoving them out of their chairs might prove that youre confident it does not make you mature Dr Pepper made an ad campaign based on individuality and I gotta be me but the commercials had most everyone wearing nearidentical red shirts with white text While all of the text was different in most crowd scenes everyone looked the same They sorta fixed this when you could buy your own customized shirt but then they went around giving people premade shirts I guess I dont gotta be me I just gotta be my shirt and drink Dr Pepper Nintendo isnt immune from this either  in 1995 and early 1996 during the early years of the PlayStation Nintendo put out commercials about their arcadeperfect Killer Instinct ports and closed each commercial with So who needs a new system Later in 1996 when the Nintendo 64 was released it aired commercials asking consumers to Change the System A lot of said consumers did  just not to the system they expected A PlayStation 3 commercial for the Move tries to say that motion control gaming is not just for children It then shows a montage of about 69 games set to what may or may not be Chariots of Fire about two of which most parents wouldnt let their child play Even worse is the fact that a 12yearold girl is seen playing one of the less childfriendly games Theres also the fact that the Wii made most of its money because motion control was successful for family gaming which one who is a little more cynical could say is the entire reason Sony made the Move Thats also not getting into the fact that the whole point of the commercial to say that motion control isnt just for children is incredibly hypocritical considering the ones who first pushed the idea that motion control gaming is only for kids were Sony themselves In the 1970s there was a wellmeaning antismoking PSA starring Yogi Bear and friends while they had been seen smoking in their cartoons and sold merchandise featuring smoking◊ Valuescom sponsors the Pass It On series of PSAs one of which is about listening Its last scene shows a woman silently washing the dishes while her husband is on his cell phone He drops it into the sink and has to fish it out scrambling to pick his call back up only to have his wife still silently take it out of his hands and smugly drop it back into the sink Instead of being pissed that his wife just drowned a hundreddollar smartphone he smiles contentedly and realizes the error of his ways and goes on to focus on listening to her The moral breaks because the story is about listening and the wife pulls this stunt while her husband was on the phone and saying nothing out loud herself What was he supposed to be listening to if not the person with whom he was already speaking There are other scenes in the commercial where the husband does want to talk and its the wife who wont listen  maybe thats okay somehow Done deliberately by an Australian PSA about staying in school made as a joke by a local ad agency It started with a montage of a group of high school students sneaking out of class to party on a closedoff beach set to optimisticsounding music and ended with a graphic depiction of all but one of them being killed by land mines as the camera panned out to reveal warning signs about the beach being an explosive testing site Because the ending is Diabolus ex Machina with no direct connection to the students decision to cut school the message instead becomes dont break into fencedin beaches which is a perfectly valid Aesop just not the intended one During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum the antiindependence No campaign ran a video called The Woman Who Made Up Her Mind which featured a woman talking to a camera in her kitchen about how this talk of independence was all very well but did the proindependence Yes campaign really know what they were talking about Did they really know what would happen She comes down against independence because she just doesnt think it will work out but the lesson that the Yes campaign hadnt done the research and didnt know what would happen is lost because although the No side was trying to present itself as the party of common sense the woman doesnt have any facts to back herself up her own doubts are entirely based on gut instinct and kneejerk distrust of politicians It was widely perceived as sexist and patronising for its portrayal of women as incapable of doing a basic Google search and in the wake of it being shown on TV the Yes campaign briefly overtook the No campaign in the polls Heres a Broken Aesop that doubles as a Clueless Aesop In the early 90s Nickelodeon ran several PSAs about the need to turn off the television and go outside Around that same time they ran a network promo depicting a kid being left alone on a baseball field because all of his friends are in the living room watching Nick The Meth Project Ads are mainly a horrorshow series about how Drugs Are Bad For the most part they do their job admirably particularly the ones directed by Darren Aronofsky whos kind of famous for that but a couple of them fall flat They feature teenagers who wish they had been horribly injured if it diverted them from going to the place they tried meth for the first time It fits the tone of the ads in general but the characters are describing a catastrophic traffic accident and physical violence implied to be a gay bashing as being preferable to going to a party and trying meth Meth is a bad idea but youre a lot more likely to recover from drug addiction than the kind of complete and isolated helplessness due to crippling injury being described as the preferable outcome the ad suggests A series of 1990s ads featuring milk would have a situation where the character would have had great fortune if theyd just been able to drink a glass of milk and say something However one of them had a man being asked what the name of a new cookie should be and mumble I dont know through a mouthful of it which his boss hears as Oreo choosing that name and praising him for the idea So is the message that if we dont have milk well do well at work Or is it that milk will help you do well at work only as long as your work doesnt involve cookies Subway restaurants One ad that aired in the Halloween season had a thin and rather beautiful woman trying to convince two average guys who were eating basic fast food to give their food a try Fair enough but her objective for getting them to eat better was so that one could look good in femaleoriented Halloween costumes So not only is the message undermined considerably ie Dont eat at our restaurant because the food is fresh and healthier do it so that you can lose weight look better in skanky outfits and be ogled by strange men but the fact she was saying this to men made little sense and would look a lot worse if she were approaching two women with the same incentive One Subway ad features a popular character acting as a spokesman for the restaurant The problem there is that the spokesman in question was Peter Griffin  you know a morbidly obese borderline sociopath Even if he did appear in the shortlived ads purely out of irony both fans and detractors of the show alike voiced their displeasure with the hypocrisy of the ads with concerns ranging from accusing the show of selling out to confusion over why a fat guy is a spokesman for a restaurant that supposedly encourages a healthier lifestyle A Subway ad featuring soccer player Megan Rapinoe has the message to choose better be better by choosing Subway over other fast food like burritos and burgers It would be perfectly fine if she tried to persuade them by extolling the virtues of the sandwich but she instead uses her athletic skills to physically compel them to her desired action In one case she somehow uses the soccer ball to order a sandwich on the parkgoers smartphone including modifications she decided on In another case she knocks food a guy already had onto the ground forcing him to replace it just because she thought her suggestion was better Thus the takeaway is less make better choices and more you are not allowed to choose what you eat for lunch Olays Make Space for Women commercial which premiered during the 2020 Super Bowl Yes more women should be involved in STEM fields except the three women going to outer space are portrayed as ditzy incompetent and they even end up blowing themselves up in the end when one of them presses the big shiny Olay button Not the kind of stereotypes you want to associate with women in STEM as these are the very outdated stereotypes that prevent women from being taken seriously in actual STEM fields in the first place A late90s Domestic Violence PSA featured a father having lunch in a cafe with his two children and an argument breaks out between a man and a woman a few tables over The argument escalates throughout the ad from yelling to threats and finally the man bodily dragging the woman out of the cafe During this escalation the camera focuses on the father listening and message cards appear rapidly When do you get involved Now Now Now Then it focuses on his young son and the card says Now The implication being that a good parent needs to teach his son young to not be an abuser Exceptyou know a woman was being abused right in front of him and he didnt do anything Not Quite the Right Thing at best One Protegent ad begins with the message that parents need to be able to trust teachers The ad itself is about a teacher noticing that someone has been looking at pornography on one of her classs computers but being unable to find out who it was Thanks to Protegents monitoring functions she finally manages to catch the culprit and decides that she will not tell his parents about what hes been doing Because teachers who keep secrets about something as big as this from their students parents are trustworthy A couple of MADD PSAs against underage drinking cautions that the younger a boy starts drinking alcohol the more likely he is to abuse it That is technically true but the scenarios they use are wholesome bonding moments that are clearly examples of responsible consumption Okay sure if a boy starts drinking habitually at a young age genetic predisposition to addiction notwithstanding hell be more likely to develop alcoholism but in general hes a lot less likely to start drinking habitually at all if he develops a healthy relationship with alcohol when hes in his teens For instance if his responsible openlyaffectionate father demonstrated moderation by allowing one celebratory beer after a successful fishing trip with his elderly grandfather or a halfshot of scotch to toast his acceptance to a prestigious university That second one is especially contradictory because the Mothers Against Drunk Driving dont even have anything to worry about theyre already home nobodys driving anywhere    Comedy  In his standup Ricky Gervais identifies the Broken Aesop inherent in a version of the childrens folk tale The Lazy Mouse and the Industrious Mouse that he was told by his headmaster at a school assembly In the story the Industrious Mouse labours long and hard to prepare himself for winter whilst the Lazy Mouse bunks off and has fun When winter comes the Lazy Mouse has nothing so goes to avail himself of the charity of the Industrious Mouse — who after beginning a lecture about how the Lazy Mouse should have done his own preparing suddenly turns around and invites him in to share Gervais notes with exasperation that the moral is mangled from being work hard and be prepared for the future into becoming in his words fuck around do whatever you want and then scrounge off a dogooder He also notes that most of the pupils at that assembly took the latter aesop and kept it up for the entirety of their academic careers He also points out that thanks to the Rule of Three the moral of the tale of The Boy Who Cried Wolf is not never tell a lie but rather never tell the same lie twice He rounds it off by inferring that the moral of Humpty Dumpty must be dont climb walls if youre an egg    Comic Strips  The Dick Tracy Crimestoppers Guide feature that runs with the Sunday strip provides several generally helpful crime prevention tips However they often are if not broken then at least hypocritical in the face of the main action It reminds that you cannot spot a criminal by their facial features while the strip is best known for its grotesquely ugly villains It also has exhortations for people to get involved when they see a crime committed while in the strip helpful bystanders tend to quickly end up dead And so on EC Segars Thimble Theater where Popeye first appeared sometimes had an And Knowing Is Half the Battle segment in which Popeye would teach morals In one of them Popeye seriously teaches kids not to be lazy with their language and mispronounce words sumpin for something for instance It was originally used as an occasional gag but after Segars untimely demise other writers sometimes forgot that it was supposed to be ironic The Wizard of Id does an annual Veterans Day strip where it pays tribute to the US military using the Id army as a metaphor for them However the rest of the year Ids military and especially their commanderinchef Sir Rodney are depicted as incompetent bumbling cowards so the compliment comes off as backhanded at best    Fairy Tales  Beauty and the Beast The story is supposedly saying that Beauty comes to see beyond the Beasts appearance and accept him for who he is except that theyre only able to live Happily Ever After when the curse is broken and he reverts to a perfect Handsome Prince and thus comes off as only beautiful people can love each other instead though this sort of neglects the fact that the transformation is the Beasts reward not Belles In the versions where he is clearly some sort of animal or mix of animals this cannot be avoided without getting too close to bestiality for most audience members comfort so for the writers this is a case of Mortons Fork The most wellknown versions of this tale by Beaumont and Disney actually cut out the worst of the original Villeneuve storys broken aesop Villeneuves backstory for the Prince revealed him to have been cursed by a fairy whos explicitly described as wicked and ugly whereas the good fairy who helps him break the curse is described as strikingly beautiful Not only that but theres a second message that emerges when the Princes mother refuses to let him marry Beauty because shes a commoner the Prince and good fairy both argue that Beautys virtues should make her worthy of his hand on their own but then the fairy explains that Beauty is actually the daughter of a fairy princess it makes sense in context sort of and hence of royal birth after all rendering that moral completely moot In a story that is supposed to be about not judging people by their appearances the most notable aspect of the heroine is her beauty It can make the story seem a bit less about looking beyond appearances and more beautiful women should be willing to settle for ugly men Some variants avoid this by making Beautys name at least partially ironic but usually she is presented as the epitome of both physical and inner beauty while her less attractive sisters are just as ugly on the inside Many variants also state explicitly that the Prince is not just handsome but the handsomest man Beauty has ever seen or even the handsomest one in the world Bluebeard by Charles Perrault seems to be going for the moral of curiosity killed the cat The heroine disobeys her husbands order to never open a certain door of his house and discovers his secret Bluebeard is a Serial Killer and the forbidden room contains the bodies of his previous wives Bluebeard learns of her intrusion and tries to kill her However the moral falls apart when one considers that she would never have found out about her husbands dark secret if she had been obedient and in most versions of the story she manages to get away from him and ends up marrying a lessmurderous guy instead a much better fate than the other wives If she hadnt looked in the forbidden room she probably would have wound up getting on Bluebeards bad side when her sister and brothers hadnt been around The true moral should be please be curious Or Be curious and not clumsy Donkey Skin Its not enough that the prince loves the beautiful mystery girl who is found hiding as a scullery maid she has to be outed as a runaway princess before the marriage is acceptable Even though her hard work intelligence bravery and sneakiness show her to be an amazing young woman There are countless legends as well as other types of works that feature the story of a young princess who is in love with a commoner but cannot marry him because he is not of noble blood Different stories end differently but in the majority of cases this commoner will be revealed to have noble blood by the end of the story The often spontaneous discovery that the commoner is a prince will suddenly lift all boundaries put a satisfied smile on the kings previouslyangry face and be followed by the sound of wedding bells In other words while the intended Aesop is usually that true love conquers all it is in fact social status that conquers all and must be properly matched before true love can do its magic Aesops Fables The Satyr and the Peasant is about a satyr who meets a poor traveler lost in the woods and invites him to his home He notices the peasant first blowing on his hands to warm them then blowing on a bowl of soup to cool it off The Satyr immediately kicks his guest out declaring that a man who blows hot and cold in the same breath cant be trusted metaphorically meaning that someone who frequently changes his mind to avoid committing to a conclusion or to align himself with both sides of a conflict The problem is obviously that the man isnt blowing hot and cold in the same breath his breath is the same temperature every time Its just that his breath is warmer than his cold hands and cooler than his hot soup meaning he was actually being consistently moderate The Tortoise and the Hare The moral is Slow and Steady Wins the Race but the hare was winning the vast majority of the race and only lost because he was so far ahead he thought he could stop to rest not noticing the tortoise caught up until too late Thus the storys aesop appears to be a warning about displaying overconfidence even if a situation seems certain — which is still a good thing to teach — as opposed to the stated lesson of going slow and steady Theres a variant of The Tortoise and the Hare where the tortoise faces a deer and rather than win through being slow and steady he gets some help by having some of his friends wait in hiding at several points during the race which makes the deer think the tortoise is somehow overtaking him Granted the deer was cocky and deserved to be knocked off a peg but winning through cheating doesnt make the tortoise better especially when the deer for all his attitude ran the race fair and square The tale of Boreas and Helios is often used to promote the moral that gentleness wins over harshness Except it doesnt work because the reasons for Helios victory and Boreas loss are inherent to the characters No matter how gentle wind would blow youd still cling on to your cloak while you wouldnt really have any choice but to take it off if the sun suddenly flared Also making someone all hot and sweaty isnt really gentle The Aesop of The Fox and the Crow is not to be vain—the crow sings so the fox steals the cheese that was in her beak However the breakage comes from the fact that the crow was singing on the foxs request and not out of vanity In most versions the Crow opens her beak and drops the cheese because the Fox flatters her by saying that she must be excellent at singing The Cock and the Jewel is the tale of a rooster who goes scratching in the yard to find himself and his hens some food and turns up a gemstone that someone lost from a piece of jewelry He says that if its owner had found it the owner would take it and put it back in its setting because its obviously a very precious stone but since hes a rooster and has no use for them hed rather have a single piece of corn than all the jewels in the world The moral is often interpreted as be content with your own lot but the rooster clearly understands that a jewel has material worth to others and he can talk The jewel could have bought him plenty of corn and nothing about his situation would have changed except he would have succeeded in providing for his family Medieval interpretations of this fable tend to make it into a religious allegory and represent the cock as foolish the jewel in these versions represents the word of God and the cock represents people who ignore spiritual matters in favor of material concerns A version of the Honest Axe fable had the moral of a river does not always bring axes—that is to say people and circumstances arent static so dont always expect the same results and what works for one person might not work for another While its a pretty good message its fallen by the wayside for the more wellknown interpretation because it doesnt really jibe with the storys events The second woodcutter doesnt fail where the first woodcutter succeeded because of an outside circumstance or a change in terms or bad luck he fails because he lied out of greed while his neighbor stayed truthful The Dog and the Wolf has a starving wolf reject a dogs offer to work on his farm knowing hell starve to death because he equates the dog being chained up for safety by a collar to slavery despite the fact that the dog is free enough to talk to a wolf in the woods without fearing for his life The moral fails because the wolf had just found a source of food a farm guarded by a dog stupid enough to approach a starving wolf in the wild and offer him a job It may be better to choose death over slavery but the way the story presents the situation thats not the choice the wolf is making Hes choosing death over slavery and stealing from his foolish enemies something that most fables present as the mark of a clever person    Music  Avril Lavignes Sk8er Boi tries to have a Kiss the Frog moral about turning a man down who becomes a pop star but the final chorus Ill be at a studio singing a song I wrote implies that the song is not from the point of view of a random other woman but Avril Lavigne herself This means that it completely ignores the extremely strong possibility that she ended up in a relationship with a pop star because she is one too BarlowGirls She Walked Away begins with a girl leaving her home and makes it sound like she was being abused and finally had the courage to leave after a Break the Cutie moment If there were tears she laughed its time to kiss the past goodbye but then suddenly has her family singing about how God should tell her to please come home making the songs apparent aesop Home is where the heart is even if youre being abused Alternately she was just a plain ol runaway The lyrics are ambiguous Right Said Fred by Bernard Cribbins is about three men trying to move something into another room but they end up taking the things off the soandso and removing the door wall and ceiling of the house Its apparent moral is dont be hasty but it falls apart when you realise that none of the things they did were hasty per se— Charlie is usually the one to suggest them while its the titular Fred whos called out for being hasty and he always thinks before suggesting something If anything the moral should be taking things off is sometimes a bad idea The Double Take song Hot Problems is about two girls singing that even though theyre hot theyre still imperfect and have their fair share of struggles At the very end they laugh and say Just kidding were perfect Parodied by the Flight of the Conchords song Think About It which takes a swipe at wellmeaning but ultimately fatuous protest songs The song raises moral issues but completely misses the point of themTheyre turning kids into slaves  Just to make cheaper sneakers  But whats the real cost  Cause the sneakers dont seem that much cheaper  Whyre we still paying so much for sneakers when youve got them made by little slave kids  What is your overhead Kat McSnatch has Dont Be a Racist Played for Laughs which starts with Kat advising about the song title only for her and her rapping partner to burst into fullblown racism Michael Jacksons They Dont Care About Us has an antibigotryinjustice message even namedropping Martin Luther King Jr at one point But thanks to poor context the lines Jew me sue me and Kick me Kke me which were supposed to be refer to Jews being treated badly rather than Jews treating others badly were misinterpreted as antiSemitic the sue me rhyme didnt help Jacksons case These two lines were changed for the single release and later pressings of the album as a result Some of Taylor Swifts songs fall victim of this Mean is one example First she states that she wont let the mean girl who insults and bullies her draw her into a Cycle of Revenge and then she spends the rest of the song mocking her for how pathetic and alone in life she is and how shell never been anything other than mean Worse the song was reportedly a Take That aimed towards a music critic who slammed Swifts singing The lesson seems less like Dont bully other people than Dont bully Taylor Swift Then you have You Belong With Me where she plays a high school girl who steals another girls boyfriend but only after she dresses and acts exactly like her despite the music video implying that the original girlfriend was unsavory by dressing the way she did The boyfriend seems content in choosing the hotter girl as looks appear to be top priority Ridin by Chamillionaire ft Krayzie Bone has a message about being racially profiled but then brags about smoking weed and driving drunk making it look like the cops are actually justified in wanting to catch them ridin dirty Meghan Trainor All About That Bass by promotes the Aesop that you are beautiful and your body is fine the way it is but then refers to skinny bitches which generated a lot of criticism for undermining its message and stereotyping women based on their weight This generally ignores the second half of the verse which acknowledges that thin women can also be insecure about their bodies and that they are perfect from the bottom to the top too Some other lines also imply that beauty is based on others opinions Its also worth noting that the heavyset male dancer in the music video is portrayed as effeminate campy and humorous while the actor playing Meghans boyfriend is slender Plenty of menboys have issues with Body Image and presenting such a Double Standard doesnt help It becomes Harsher in Hindsight after she told People magazine that she tried to go anorexic she really just tried dieting which was pretty insensitive towards people who actually have eating disorders Plus despite promoting girl power she claims that shes not a feminist because she thinks it carries a negative connotation which makes most of her songs seem like Broken Aesops Theres a Bowdlerized version of All About That Bass which changes the line boys like a little more booty to hold at night to boys like their girls for the beauty they hold inside which completely contradicts the intended message about body positivity The Finnish song Albatrossi Albatross by Juha Vainio tells the story of two childhood friends who went their different ways the narrator wishes he had been like the other who took charge of his own life and became a sailor The central explicit metaphor is that the sailor is like a tireless and free albatross while the narrator has been like a gull the man who doesnt finish his work and who builds everything on mere dreams But the actual story before this was that the sailor ran off to the sea when fifteen while the narrator stayed behind studying and working as he was expected to do — and regretted not following his dreams The sailor may have been more determined to seize the day but the difference between the characters was hardly that he worked harder instead of building his life on a dream The song is based on one of Juha Vainios childhood friends who indeed did become a sailor But given to the fact Juha Vainio had quite hollow legs the flip side of the maritime life would most likely have proven him disastrous The Christmas Shoes by NewSong gets a lot of criticism for the less sentimental interpretation of its message  but the message itself is broken just by the events of the song The opening lines paint the narrators obligate giftbuying as being against the spirit of Christmas but the whole point of the story is that the little boy is spending Christmas Eve trying to buy a material gift for his dying mother so she can look beautiful when she meets Jesus instead of actually spending time with her Covens One Tin Soldier is an illustration of the perils of using a moral ideal to justify mistreating others sarcastically encouraging the audience to go ahead and be an asshole in the name of Heaven because youll always be able to say you did the right thing and there wont be anyone to call out the winner if they make sure all the losers are dead Unfortunately the actual story being told to the children is a fable about the Valley People sacking the Mountain Peoples castle to steal their treasure only to find that the treasure is just the idea of peace The moral fails because the Valley People demand literal gold and rather than just saying that there isnt any the Mountain People offer to share their treasure and just never send anything back Sure the Valley People are greedy dicks but the conflict was a matter of Poor Communication Kills not a moral issue It also fails because the Valley People never actually try to justify their actions and their motives are nakedly take their stuff because we can Harry Chapins iconic Cats in the Cradle is about a neglectful father who is always working too hard to spend time with his son whose son nevertheless grows up idolising him and swearing to become just like him At the end of the song when the son has grown up and the father retired the father tries to connect with his son now that he has time to spend only to be brushed off by the son whos too busy with his own work now leading to the father realising Hed grown up just like me Except rather than growing up to neglect his own kids the way his father neglected him one of the reasons the son actually cites for having no time for his father is the kids have the flu so it ends up being less about a cycle of mistakes being perpetuated and more about the father being treated the same way he treated his son who grew up to be the opposite of his father despite the repeated line Im gonna be like you Dad you know Im gonna be like you In Melanie Martinezs Lunchbox Friend Melanie complains about people judging her for smoking weed However in Dollhouse she treats the brother smoking weed as a character flaw    Music Videos  The Lemon Demon song Geeks in Love has a fairly good if tiredout message by itself that it is better to be unique and spend time with the rare person who shares your own interests than to be hip and hang with the crowd However its music video by Albino Black Sheep functions largely as a tribute to every other annoying Internet fad in the world and aligning them with the interests of the eponymous couple Its not really individualism when you swap one dull set of popculture icons out for another just like it Michael Jackson examples Michael Jacksons Ghosts according to Word of God is a story of how True Beauty Is on the Inside and how just because a person is different from others doesnt make them bad Unfortunately the two characters Jackson plays both break the aesop The bigoted Mayor — a fat middleaged white guy — is mocked throughout with no redeeming qualities The ostensibly good Maestro — effectively Jackson himself — magically imprisons the angry mob confronting them and tortures the helpless Mayor proving he really was the dangerous freaky boy the Mayor accused him of being Even if you ignore the Mayor and the mob of paranoid parents the Maestro is still a necromancer who regularly summons a bunch of undead to do his bidding Thats a legitimate concern for an otherwise normal suburban neighborhood The music video of Bad has Michael being bullied by gang members for being a pussy because he refused to rob people and doesnt hang down with them a lot Michael confronts them by — suddenly appearing in a leather outfit and doing an impressive singanddance routine where he boasts about how bad he is In the end the others who doubted him do respect him So what was the message exactly Give in to peer pressure Its good to be bad because you would rather be called that than being called a coward Being bad equals being a good singer and dancer It seems that Michael was Comically Missing the Point the gang member was trying to make Black or White has the panther dance near the end of the video where Michael smashes up a car and windows and then transforms into a black panther It confused a lot of people especially because the violence is such a contrast with the rest of the video And the black panther also brings up associations with the AfroAmerican Black Panther movement whose members werent always that peaceful or tolerant to nonblacks either In later broadcasts the panther dance was cut from the video which makes it work a whole lot better on its own When it was finally reinstated racist messages were digitally added to the things Michael smashes in the video giving it a more understandable context Notorious BIG and Puff Daddys video for Mo Money Mo Problems stars Puff as a golf champion who laments over his recent acquisition of wealth in lieu with the songs title For some reason that doesnt seem to stop him from rapping for about three minutes about how awesome it is to be rich Queens song Radio Ga Ga is all about how music video is ruining music and we should all just listen to the radio instead The accompanying music video features lavish sets and costumes footage from the film Metropolis the restoration of which it was made to promote and a montage of clips of music videos from earlier Queen songs The animated music video for Teddyloids MEMEME is pretty intense and is subject to a few varying interpretations but the message is laid out fairly clearly no matter which one you go with massproduced consumerdriven sexuality is damaging and unsatisfying compared to real relationships For all the otherwise welldone and disturbingly powerful imagery it contrasts the massproduced Moe sex kittens with the real girl by having the real girl look more or less exactly like them except she dresses modestly and is crying helplessly and in danger Its really not helping the message to design your badgirl villains according to the emotionallymanipulative design tropes of the Moe type and then use those same emotionallymanipulative design tropes to make your goodgirl damsel more sympathetic to the audience The music video for Disturbeds The Vengeful One a song about blaming the media for mass shooters has the bands mascotavatar going on a shooting spree against the media breaking into the news building and gunning down as many of them as he can It even includes phrases straight out of a psychotic active shooters manifesto like Im the hand of God Im the dark messiah It turns the aesop from Stop giving mass shooters attention it just creates more of them to Mass shootings are okay and actually very cool as long as you pick the right target    Print Media  An educational magazine called Science World once did a feature called The State of All There Is vs Humanity in which the human race is on trial for the death of Mother Nature and the punishment if convicted is extinction What breaks the aesop is the fact that it looks like the defense attorney isnt even trying    Pro Wrestling  Pro wrestling is at best a weird place to promote antibullying sentiments and at worst actively undermined by the content of the product where even the biggest babyface is still going to be using violence and trash talk to resolve his problems but WWE soldiers on anyway in the interest of doing some good in the world However they are still a pro wrestling promotion and WWE was called out on the dissonance of their antibullying campaign Be A Star in 2011 by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards by winning the award for Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic due to their mistreatment of Jim Ross at the time of this campaign Others have pointed out that WWE have a long history of enabling or even actively encouraging extreme bullying and hazing not only between wrestlers but also towards other employees Although supposedly toned down from the old days it is allegedly still going on to the point that some people have been driven out of the company John Cenas Rise Above Hate slogan is understandable but still troublesome Kane was deliberately trying to get Cena to break this Aesop and Embrace the Hate but if you examine the two characters of John Cena and Kane carefully youll see that a problem has existed there from the very beginning After all Cena is hardly brave for refusing to surrender to feelings of hate when he is worldfamous absurdly successful fabulously wealthy and is loved by at least a bare majority of the WWE Universe  and thus has no reason in the world to experience hate Conversely is Kane really such a monster for being so full of hate when he was nearly burned to death as a child suffered years of psychological trauma that left him unable to speak for a long time accidentally killed his high school sweetheart in a car crash and had this revealed on live television along with the lie that he killed the girl on purpose and then had sexual intercourse with her corpse lost the unborn child he fathered and was betrayed by his wife was tricked into causing the death of his father and in general is loathed and ignored by the better part of the human race In

fluff of Warhammer 40000 a beloved minor character was Ollanius Pius the name given to an unknown guardsman who sacrificed himself by heroically charging at Horus in protection of his Emperor and defiance of the Dark Powers Though Pius was immediately vaporized he was held up as a shining example of a Badass Normal and what makes the Imperial Guard what it is and the sight of Horus deliberately destroying a man who was objectively no threat to him is what finally convinced the Emperor that Horus could not be saved Until he was retconned as being a superhuman Space Marine and then a member of the Adeptus Custodes who are to the Space Marines what a Space Marine is to a human When he was eventually brought back into canon he was turned into a Perpetual a sort of Superimmortal who can regenerate From a Single Cell that had been alive since ancient earth Needless to say this kinda undermines the idea of him being a normal man who bravely spat in the face of

continued source of frustration for Lorrell that Jimmy wont commit to her because hes married and eventually she breaks up with him when shes sick of his crap This is supposed to be a crowning moment of awesome for Lorrell showing that she is finally standing up for herself However as much as Jimmy is cast in a negative light for engaging in a yearslong affair Lorrell is never called out for willingly taking part in it She only breaks up with him because shes not getting what she wants not due to the immorality of the situation The Team StarKid show Firebringer has a subplot that claims religion is deluded and evil the tribe shamans belief in an allpowerful duck that made the world in seven quacks feels awfully specific It feels very awkward however when the big message that there is no God is delivered by one of the Ancient Astronauts from the species that created life on earth The Gingerbread House In The Forest has Johann chastising Gretel for assuming Nada is a witch just because she is ugly Nada is a witch Molière often has stories involving young people in love wanting to marry despite being richpoor or noblecommoner and most time at least one has his parents planning an Arranged Marriage for him Stories always end with the poor revealed to be actually rich the commoner a noble In Les Fourberies de Scapin he also makes two pairs of people revealed to be actually brother and sister Remember Molière was playing for the king so the twist endings mean the stories can be interpreted as being about refusing the parental Arranged Marriage then the last five minutes have the parents agree with the true love marriage In a case of a perfectly decent moral being killed by a followup the ending of the original The Phantom of the Opera was the Phantom letting Christine go because he recognized that she wouldnt be happy with him because hes a psychotic murderer and she isnt Moral  If you really love a person recognize their right to turn you down Theres also the fact that the Phantom is a pariah because of his appearance and the main reason he is the way he is owes to this unfair ostracism Moral  Bad people are often only victims of their environment and could change if they were ever shown kindness But in Love Never Dies the distant sequel its proclaimed that Christine actually was pining for the Phantom they have an illegitimate kid and her life with her actual love interest Raul is shown to be unhappy Meanwhile the Phantom has become incredibly wealthy and is surrounded by an entourage and admirers but hes just as much of a violent possessive weirdo as ever This pretty handily breaks both morals turns out that the Phantom was right to try to keep Christine to himself forever and hed be an asshole no matter what RENT We are told we should all live our lives to the fullest because we could die tomorrow and there is no day like today But if you do happen to die you can come back to life through The Power of Rock The concept of

friends seems to have a lot of cheating poor communication and emotional sniping at each other  no one is enjoying themselves very much or following Angels lauded example And for that matter Collins who spends his time loving Angel and loving life with Angel ends up broken because of Angels death In The Scarlet Sails the intended aesop of not letting go of your dreams falls somewhat flat The musical aims at praising hope dreaminess and the power of imagination like the original book did However the books dreamy heroine who manages to have a fulfilling life despite the ostracism she faces is turned into a borderline lunatic whose entire life is centred on her dream of the scarlet sails The bullying she faces is depicted in grim detail her relationship with her own father is dysfunctional and the one time she is shown to be cheerful is when she decides to lay her dreaming aside and attend the local tavern Likewise the original books hopeful message of dreams coming true is preserved in the musical but severely undermined by the changes made to the books plot Assols imaginary Prince Charming really turns out to be a charismatic kindhearted Rebel Prince well nobleman in the book while here he is Demoted to Extra and first appears as just a random sailor having fun at a brothel Starlight Express According to the finale electricity and diesel fuel will eventually run out but somehow steam power is sustainable What exactly are we burning to get this magical steam Also woodcoal burning steam engines are better than environmentally friendly options like solar and nuclear power This last one may be because it was written in the 1980s In the closing number Light At The End Of The Tunnel the characters do briefly consider solar and nuclear energy but then dismiss them because 1 How is one supposed to make use of solar power at night and 2 People would get poisoned by nuclear fallout Legitimate complaints oversimplified to be sure  but then this is a childrens story Richard Stilgoe the shows lyricist knew full well that steam engines polluted the environment he claimed that it was far easier for audiences to sympathize with a steam locomotive than a diesel or electric one since steamers had more of a historical precedent But the finale according to him is meant to symbolize the triumph of oldfashioned craftsmanship over new technology Take a moment to consider why a steam locomotive is not a suitable representative of oldfashioned craftsmanship Wicked Wickeds primary question what makes one wicked and all the messages that go with it end up mildly broken due to the Lighter and Softer adaptation For all of Elphabas problems in the musical she is never truly wicked so the musings seem kind of pointless Also the admittedly depressing aesop of No

consumers who all consume the same band fashions music and lifestyles Our heroes are the Bohemians underground rebels who oppose the mainstream and wish to reclaim the old ways At the end of the show our heroes realize that to defeat the villains they have to perform an awesome song mainly Queens We Will Rock You They decide to also broadcast the performance so that the whole world will see and

is a Risk clone that requires you to disarm all your territories to win the game in an antiwar aesop You need to first build arms so you can conquer territories The Crash Test Dummies were part of a series of public service announcements to teach kids about seat belt safety and the importance of buckling up This was popular enough to get a line of toy vehicles and dummy figures where the entire point was crashing the cars and watching the dolls fly out of the wreckage and the villain wanted to stop them from crashing so much because horrific traffic accidents are just the best thing ever So buckle up kids Then drive into a wall and scatter car parts all over the highway Safety first Chutes and Ladders is a childrens board game with very ancient roots which purports to teach the

romantic fantasies However the visual novel randomly introduces a female character with no other purpose than to fulfill the romantic fantasies of the female main character REFLEXIA Prototype ver a visual novel on Steam that is a metaparody of Dating Sim is meant to be a satire on how visual novels trick people into caring about onedimensional characters This is taken so far as to insult the player for caring about fictional characters However the second half is devoted to  the characters emotional problems So the VN insults you for carrying about fictional characters then expects you to care about its fictional characters The hypocrisy is never address despite it undermining the entire satire of the game    Web Animation  Helluva Boss In the episode Seeing Stars Loonas speech to Octavia about parents not getting everything right when they try to be good parents rings hollow considering the show had never really shown Blitzos failures as a father always showing him as a overdoting and loving parent that gets a little too affectionate sometimes On the flip side Loona was the one who is always acting abrasive having beaten the crap out of him for telling her to adjust her attitude with their clients at the beginning of the episode after the speech she kicks Blitzo in the groins when he tries to apologize and hug Loona for threatening to replace her Even acknowledging her backstory revealed in this episode Loona comes off as hypocritical telling Octavia to cut her dad some slack when she herself refuses to Its also hard to say why Loona would extend this empathy towards Stolas given they have never had a conversation and from her perspective it would be easy to conclude Stolas is sexually exploiting Blitzo in exchange for the book but she cant extend the same understanding to Blitzo who she does know and he does care for her Sam  Mickey InUniverse In Career Girl Barbie gives Kellys class a speech that appears to promote hard work as she

readers have emphatically stated Philippe will always be five A few Alex Law comics discuss this trope in various pieces of media One examines the tendency for adventure franchises to learn that a villain has broke bad because they were mistreated by various societal structures and while they do take down the villain and plan to make a better future they often just topple the villain the same way that villain suffered and never address the structures that drove the villain to lash out in the first place Another looks at a tendency for girl empowerment franchises to still be gender restrictive The protagonist of the comic is a courageous and powerful young woman who despises various oppressive gender roles but shes only allowed to be mad about ones that were already outdated by the time of release still upholds contemporary expectations of femininity and almost exclusively faces opponents that are gender nonconforming in some way In CtrlAltDel the comic makes it clear its wrong to be a console fanboy in one strip even having God personally squash one However there are issues with this since the fanboys are always Gamecube fans the evil Gamer King in an early strip used a staff with a golden Gamecube controller on top versus Ethans Xbox one Ethan playing a Gamecube is referred to as a sin against the gaming gods he mentions that turning the Gamecube into a robot would result in a girl robot and doing the same to a Playstation would produce a gay one while the Xbox appears to be perfect and sinless In Dragon Ball Multiverse when Vegito says his daughter U16 Bra is too unstable to be kept alive the heroes dismiss his concerns and say he should attempt to redeem his target not kill them Word of God later seconded this point The problem is love does not prevent Bra from going berserk in Super Saiyan 2 it didnt the first time before Vegitos death threat nor does love shake her out of her berserk moments—only physical force or regret What really makes this a Broken Aesop is how U16 Bras control issues get solved before this by Babidi taking over her mind and somehow making her able to control Super Saiyan 2 without going berserk If anything the answer wasnt using more love but more force In El Goonish Shive while doing their review show Elliot and Susan discuss a movie that undermines its own moral The heavy racism is bad morals in Goblins dont really work for a few reasons but the biggest one is that the comic attempts to attack the idea of the GuiltFree Extermination War by having it be treated as wrong for the humans to slaughter goblins This is fine in a vacuum but the eponymous goblins also carry out wholesale slaughter of humans regularly which is dismissed with a Hand Wave of all those humans we killed were evil  a common justification for the guiltfree extermination war that the comic tries to attack In general the story also pushes Humans Are the Real Monsters there are only two sympathetic civilized characters and only one evil goblin who is motivated by something humans did to her to such a degree that were one to turn the goblins into humans and the humans into goblins the narrative would likely come across as a completely standard paean to goblin genocide The series reconstructs the moral by showing that the goblins are just as diverse and disunified as humans the tribe that regularly slaughters the most humans and enslaves other goblins is explicitly shown to be goblinsupremacist and the other goblins act in appropriate revulsion Later on Minmax makes peace with the goblins he vowed to kill earlier in the face of a real threat the Big Bad  who is revealed to have discovered an exploit that makes him immune to anything that would normally react to his regularly evil ways proving there is no hand wave strong enough to justify BlackandWhite Morality Homestuck The trolls have differentcolored blood ranked on a spectrum the closer your blood is to purple the more power you have in society while the closer it is to red the less authority you hold the rationale being that highbloods are superior due to the fact theyre viewed as stronger The author stated that he made the opposite ends of the spectrum so close to show how meaningless the whole thing was and true to form the audience is clearly intended to view the practice as wrong and side with the trolls opposed to it except trolls do not differ only in blood color it is shown that highbloods actually are stronger more psychically resilient and longerlived albeit more violent which the trolls would probably consider a good thing anyway but compensate by having less powerful psychic abilities than lowbloods The metaphor for racism fails because blood color actually does matter in several ways The aesop is broken again when another alien race is introduced that has its blood color as an indicator of their alignment Greenblooded members of that species are benevolent and redblooded members are malevolent and from the four examples of them givenSpoilers Calliope Caliborn and both of their parents none of them challenge this at all They do not have a caste system based on blood color but their blood color still does matter more so than trolls since it either gives or indicates whether theyre good or evil After watching the B2 players fall victim to Trickster Mode subsequently using it as a shortcut to progress in their quest and then dealing with Caliborn demanding they do it again Hussie tells him that the characters cant just wave a magic lollipop juju around and solve all their problems He compares it to Mario grabbing a starman and plowing through the level with no challenge making the argument that its terrible for his personal development True enough the players are worse off afterward but at least theyre still on the road towards their Character Development The aesop falls apart when the biggest Wham Episode in the comic is simply written out of existence by using another juju to bring Vriska back to life and have her bully the other characters out of their personal problems and into action all while simultaneously inflating her own ego The biggest offense is that Vriska being alive was completely unnecessary John simply needed to use the juju to keep the ring of life out of Araneas hands Fans who were waiting for the other shoe to drop ie the biggest Break the Haughty session for Vriska followed by John and Roxy returning to the old timeline and fixing things there were disappointed the comic ends with only John and Roxy completing their character quests Vriska avoiding karma and the other characters followed throughout the story dead while alternate versions who had an easier way out finish the story for them The Trickster portion also depicts Trickster Mode where the characters become colorful moresuperpowered happier versions of themselves with No Sense of Personal Space caused by jujumagic as a cheap artificial creepy thing that does not solve problems The problem is that the story breaks this when alternate versions of Rose and Davesprite respectively become Jasprosprite2 and Davepetasprite2 Colorful moresuperpowered happier versions of themselves caused by mystical sprite fusion with the former having no sense of personal space This time however readers are just supposed to take these sudden transformations as them being happier and a resolution for their personal issues at face value Inverloch dealt with racism through interspecies prejudice None of the sentient races like each other with the civilized but animalisticlooking dakor suffering most due to humans pushing into their territory and abducting young males for arena battles and the elves carelessly reneged on a promise to help Acheron is the exemplar for dakor not being violent barbarians except that the character everyone thinks is Acheron is really an elfs soul transposed into his body while the real Acheron is in an elf so he can seek revenge for his murdered father And ultimately the solution found to protect the dakor from being whittled to nothing is for them all to uproot from their home to live segregated on a faraway island Jack Hell Is That Noise is the story of Todd a soldier who obeys an order to kill children commits suicide and ends up in Hell He argues that he had no choice and Fate had already decided what would happen in his life The story and everyone in it judges Todd for refusing to take responsibility for his actions but that order came from Satan disguised as a general meaning that Todd was a Cosmic Plaything after all The nonlinear nature of time in Hell tends to screw around wildly with the concept of free will and personal choice the Devil often resorts to directly manipulating the circumstances of the past and future to compel his victims to act and then blame them for it all This is most notable with Drip Its his own fault that his parents are dead because the Devil has him in a Stable Time Loop hes sent to live with his grandmother after his parents die his grandmother abuses him until he becomes a violent rapist and when he dies the Devil trades him a memento of his dead mother for a favor the murder of his own parents This has the added bonus of making the angels complicit in almost everything Drip does since they only refrain from saving any of his victims because it has to be his choice Central is later shown to have murdered Bob and Lisa specifically to prevent them from turning away from their life of sin meaning that actually choice doesnt matter at all The correct course of action is the one that generates the most rape scenes And then theres the part where furries have replaced humanity but for some reason are repeating human history exactly so we still have events like the Vietnam War reenacted by furries This means that we still get furry Charles Manson and furry Jeffrey Dahmer too And that would be fine except that God is deliberately enforcing the reenactment and is sending billions of furries to Hell for their part in it This means that God not only deprived every living furry of free will she also had full and absolute knowledge of what she was forcing them into doing to themselves and each other and what Satan would do in response but did absolutely nothing to stop it In other words she condemned countless innocent people to eternal suffering to punish them for something she forced them to do The entire comic is about choice and personal responsibility but the only character who has unquestionable free will is God herself and there are no consequences for anything she does ever because shes in charge of the entire universe while everyone else can just go to Hell The general lesson being taught to all those sent to Hell is to realize their own sin and allow them to atone for it and that Hell exists to force them to confront their misdeeds in life but theyre too busy being tortured to contemplate the philosophical implications of the torture itself Even the ones who do realize their sin and repent never make it out of Hell and its impossible for them to successfully do that unless agents of Heaven intercede on their behalf and the agents of Hell dont prevent it One of the afterlifes options is Purgatory an idealized Earth that lacks the oneness with the divine that Heaven boasts and also doesnt house the kind of sanctimonious goodytwoshoes types that go to Heaven or the assholes that go to Hell People who go there are offered a chance at reincarnation a chance to try again at life in the hopes that theyll earn entry into Heaven next time Like all things in Heaven and Hell it has to be a matter of personal choice to be meaningful and so to give the choice meaning returning to Earth after Purgatory means God will intentionally force a second life to be harder than the first and ban all further entry into Purgatory This all but guarantees that a reincarnated soul whos been to Purgatory is going to Hell but the choice is there And then that moral gets shattered into pieces because God is happy to send angels to Purgatory on a mission to remind them what kind of awesome sex theyre missing out on by offering sex and not taking no for an answer The comic loves to remind the reader of how important personal choice is but only if the personal choice is the correct one Lovely People The comic and its afterword both criticize the Social Credit system depicted in the story for suppressing freedom of religion and expression in the name nominal ideals of equality and correctness However both also come across as telling the reader that the brand of Christianity that the author adheres to is the only correct alternative to the system A Princess Pi comic had Princess Pi learn to believe in herself and not let bullies insults bring her down The Aesop breaks when she starts believing her most mediocre attempts at fulfilling her royal duties suffice and doesnt let her subjects complaints bring her down until they tar and feather her Questionable Content inuniverse As a child Clinton was careless with some fireworks and lost his hand as a result However Clinton is such an AI fanboy that hes psyched to get a robotic prosthetic as a replacement and cheerfully tells people hes glad he did it Sabrina Online had a series of strips in December 2010 which were a reference to the sequence in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back where the two heroes go on the road and beat up everyone who ever criticized them on the Internet It works in the film because its entirely incharacter In the comic however its a series of Take Thats against the strips critics One notable strip involves Zig Zag the viewpoint character for this sequence beating up a guy who said mean things about her because he thinks he can say anything on the Internet without consequences This isnt exactly true but thats not the Broken Aesop Whats broken is the fact that Zig is the owner and star of her own porno company You know the industry that has historically relied on First Amendment rights to stay in business And the consequences bit doesnt work either because legally Zig Zag committed realworld premeditated firstdegree assault against a guy who knows her name her face and could easily press charges The implication in the comic is that shell suffer no repercussions at all When Sabrina brings this up later Zig Zag admits that it cost her a small fortune to settle all the legal issues But it was worth it Although the incident does get mentioned during her trial◊ for assaulting Sabrinas mugger And we eventually learn◊ that Zig was convicted paid a fine and entered courtordered anger management counseling Early on in Selkie the titular character offers Todd her favourite food fish eyes Todd refuses on account of being a vegetarian but later Todds dad says that part of being a dad is knowing when to suck it up and eat the eyeballs This is meant to convey a moral about putting your childs happiness before your own which on the face of it is a sound moral but the problem is that it only really makes sense when the happiness the child gets is greater than the unhappiness experienced by the parent This is not the case with the fish eyes because seeing Todd eat the eyes would have only given Selkie a small amount of pleasure she seems disappointed when he refuses but only very slightly while it could have upset Todd a lot more due to conflicting with his moral views This Aesop is further broken by the webcomics overarching moral accept people who are different to you even if you dont understand them or their culture According to that Todd should be accepted for who he is not forced to eat foods which make him uncomfortable based on the whims of an eightyearold Shortpacked constantly complains about fandoms particularly the Transformers fandom as do author David Willis newsposts Willis is not only a prominent part of said fandom but also embodies many of the issues he complains about This is often Played for Laughs Sonichu is ripe for the picking of Broken Aesops One of the most well known is when Sonichu and Rosechu preach forgiveness shortly before Rosechu viciously maims Jason Kendric Howell For throwing a pickle at her Sly Cooper Thief of Virtue tried to introduce an objectivist Aesop on how everything was a matter of choice and that the characters made their choices and brought the results on themselves but both the fact that  the crystals influenced the judgement of anyone who was using them as demonstrated through how Torus behavior was altered by the crystal he was carrying in the chapter Wrath of the Wolf King and key details in the laterreleased side stories about what lead to the insanity of Ice and Snow undermine the entire point the author was trying to make Vegan Artbook has many examples The series continually denounces killing animals for meat is violent but the protagonists often have been shown willing to hurt in Sterks case kill people who disagree with them It has frequently talked about how animals tend to practice pretty horrific actions then goes back to its typical message about being compassionate towards animals and scornful of humans Brie Plausibell is supposed to live by the motto of Live and Let Live however every time her brother Shawn allows her to tolerate each others lifestyles she rejects his offer and refuses to see eye to eye with him or any other nonvegan due to believing that respecting the right to eat meat is equal to supporting victimizing animals The narrative treats this hypocrisy as adhering to her views and frames Shawn as being antivegan The author continually advocates against bodyshaming and often depicts Shawn engaging in making fun of those who are thin or fat However she portrays preredesign Cuntons and Tommytwo of the three recurring characters who are overweightas grotesque and implies that their girth is due to eating meat Even her positivelyportrayed vegan fat girl character Mike is a junkfood junkie which can be seen as enforcing stereotypes about fat people being obsessed with food whose weight is attributed to what her mother fed her before she went vegan The characters and narrative speak out against the evils of bigotry while displaying disgust for anyone who isnt vegan objectifying women to spread an antimeat messagenote One strip involves a character using a photo of a naked woman to represent a pig on a farm and using sexual orientation as an insultnote One strip involves two girls insulting Shaun by saying his leather outfit will lead to him being Mistaken for Gay Killing and eating animals is decried as preying on the weak and defenseless however this doesnt stop stronger vegans like Rohit from beating up on weaker nonvegans in order to take out their anger on them One of the main messages of the series is how animal agriculture or hunting is inherently cruel and abusive But support forcing inherently carnivorous species such as a fennec fox in one strip to go vegan which can actually be seen as an abusive practice due to how dangerous it can be to them In addition it also contradicts the message about how people shouldnt force their wills on animals In this case the vegans are forcing animals to comply with their lifestyle even if it can harm them When called out on the vegans many assaults and murders Yerdian excuses them as being fictional and therefore no big deal Yet when a nonvegan does something harmful its treated exactly as heinous as it would be in real life despite also being fictional Her Evolution of Man comic blows its antiviolence aesop by showing the human in the Good version of evolution wielding a spear The comic seems to say that being an Animal Lover is the way to go while Bad People Abuse Animals— yet one of the main villains Cuntons is portrayed as loving cats Elise is meant to be a Hypocrite for giving the burger to Tommy but not a cat telling the cat the burger is unhealthy and Sterk has killed a cat in one strip which turns the message into animals are great except for cats and the aforementioned humans xkcd I Could Care Less The author dislikes Grammar Nazis In this strip one character corrects the form of what the other just said The other goes on a long explanation about ambiguity and language and human connection and ends with I assume youre giving me tips on how to interpret words because you want me to feel less alone If so then thank you That means a lot But if youre just running my sentences past some mental checklist so you can show off how well you know it then I could care less So the moral is that you shouldnt criticize the way others say things because of all these things that are more important about communication — but the character who talked about this was really only invoking these deep issues to make the first character feel bad about what she saidnote at least provided the first character had the wrong kind of motive in saying it but that I assume doesnt sound very sincere in the light of what follows Its also a False Dichotomy but thats another issue Sinfest has a weird history of going from a gagaday comic to a sequential art comic with hardcore extreme feminist narrative and themes Some of these narratives do not mesh well with what the comic is attempting to preach as constantly showing problems that the female characters deal with being solved by accident or with no actual input from them Case in point one story arc features a brothel in which the braindead males go to for kicks and the women dont want to be there One of the characters attempts to try and leave and the pimp who owns the brothel refuses only for him to get unexpectedly run over by a passing car The women are shocked and happy at their freedom and the men who frequent the brothel simply lament at their loss The confusing this about the narrative is that female empowerment is important but the problem got solved by pure accident The women were incapable of solving this problem themselves and rather had to wait for the problem to be solved on its own It cuts the female empowerment message the comic shoves down your throat by undermining the abilities of the very group it portrays and giving them victory by pure accident    Web Original  Coming from The Angry Video Game Nerd a character who is synonymous with Rolling Rock Beer this line paraphrased from American Movie is actually pretty darned funny but I guess its better than using drugs or alcohol because with drugs and alcohol especially drugs you always lose lose lose Channel Awesome Because of a Creator Breakdown and Real Life Writes the Plot The Review Must Go On had Dougs past consume what was meant to be his masterpiece the direct opposite of what Demo Reels Earn Your Happy Ending episode said Dont let your past consume you and be happy for the future This seems to be intentional and the commentary for it says that its not supposed to be a happy ending Doug Walker once made a plea in an editorial Is Parody Dead that parodies should not just be references and that they all need to be a clear understanding of what you are spoofing A good message yet in most of his own videos including Nostalgia Critic Demo Reel and his anniversary specials he makes countless random pop culture references and spoofs that often dont even tie in with the plot of that episode He and his actors often just dress up as wellknown franchise characters sometimes to avoid copyright issues but more commonly for no real reason To Boldly Flee in particular comes uncomfortably close to films like Disaster Movie at points randomly tossing in characters scenes and ideas from various scifi properties for no real reason Discussed in the Walker Brothers Honest Thoughts review of the Care Bears movies Rob notes that while lots of shows talk about The Power of Friendship they still end their conflict by defeating the villain with violence He credits the first two movies for not

Quintessential MarySue has the message that such characters are bad and turn every story in which they appear into a Crapsack World Unfortunately there is the slight problem that the Villain Protagonists amnesiac good half once she reclaims her memories is just as unrealistically talented but is a genuine hero whom the audience is rooting for Its then further broken by the fact that the Sue is only able to win and create a Villain World by blatant Diabolus ex Machina breaking the previously established rules of the setting and somehow usurping God even after she was explicitly defeated and killed That said the author does recognize this and includes a disclaimer at the end of Part 2 suggesting that readers disregard the third part if they want the story to have a happy

person cannot afford anything based on appearance The submitter always believes this to have a Dont judge a book by its cover aesop The thing is that the submitters always walk into these stores in

Heroic BSoD,A problem has been detected and Windows of the Soul has been shut down to prevent damage to your brain Well lad the brain be a funny thing Sometimes it just stops workin right when yeve been through a bad scene— Durkon The Order of the Stick Strip 247A stunning revelation or horrible event affects a character or someone they care deeply about leaving them shocked to the point of mentally shutting down for a while analogous to the Blue Screen of Death The effect is similar to passing a Despair Event Horizon but is temporary rather than permanent Alternatively if say this occurs during a fight a hero may have a violent outburst killing Evil Minions and hurling their own companions aside They may run off and have to be tracked down by their friends for Epiphany Therapy Alone in a Crowd typically represents a milder nondisabling form of BSOD a related trope is Heroic Safe Mode wherein the hero defaults to a fight or flight mindset before rebooting in safety A ShellShocked Veteran may have a BSOD in their back storyThe trope name notwithstanding the character suffering a Heroic BSOD may not necessarily be a fullyfledged hero However if something like this happens to a more ambiguous or mundane character it is much more likely to be Played for Laughs or just taken less seriously But a BSOD is never brief or trivial the effect must involve some kind of total mental shutdown to qualify Also an outright villain suffering a similar effect will usually experience a Villainous Breakdown often involving them going completely crazy instead of shutting down or a Villainous BSoD whereby they gain a consciencePossible triggers include failing in something crucial such as saving a loved one or being restricted in what you can do to help being betrayed by a close friend being forced to make an impossible choice eg having to choose between using evil methods or laying friends open to attack or being hit with a Breaking Speech or ArmorPiercing Question Other tropes such as These Hands Have Killed often overlap When the trope is Played for Laughs or used for melodramatic effect the cause can be less substantial deranged behavior from someone supposedly sane seeing something completely surreal or being hit with a Wall of Text sayOther people can attempt to reboot the character Get A Hold Of Yourself Man may work especially in the stories where violence is always the answer as may telling them to Quit Your Whining The best thing that can happen to a hero suffering from a BSOD is meeting a friendly Warrior Therapist the worst thing is meeting a hostile Warrior Therapist as such a foe can ensure that the hero crashes completely driving them over the edge into the Despair Event HorizonEven after regaining some function a BSOD sufferer may evince a ThousandYard Stare or go into 10Minute Retirement In the longer term a hero may become emotionally comatose entering an Angst Coma obsessive and guiltridden mute or in really bad cases a jaded violent amnesiac A really longterm BSOD would be catatonia Go Mad from the Revelation is the worst case Those who remain functional but dont find a cure for the problem may eventually find Safety in Indifference or Emotion Suppression other people may fear that they have become a Fallen HeroComedy and melodramatic uses of the trope such as a film or game reviewer having a Critic Breakdown are far less likely to lead to longterm problems the character simply snaps back after a few minutes A character in a slapstick comedy show may be thrown into several blue screens in one episode as a Running GagIf opponents discover a characters BSOD trigger they may employ it as a weapon — although if they overuse it the victim may wise up and seek treatment Even comedy characters can find that a BSOD leads to Character Development marking the start of a series of new experiences or causing them to revise their worldview Hope Is Scary is a frequent reaction to the beginning of recovery for any character Hes Back often marks a characters full recovery perhaps accompanied by a No More Holding Back Speech Conversely a character who never recovers has fallen over the Despair Event HorizonCompare Heroic RRoD the physical equivalent Freak Out and Deer in the Headlights If the character is a sweetheart this trope can be the end result of Break the Cutie One common reaction is I Think You Broke Him In Real Life psychology this sort of thing is known as an acute stress reaction or a mental breakdown and is related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder If a character goes into the BSOD state because of issues or revelations regarding who or what they are theyre having an Identity Breakdown If a character starts singing about their or someone elses Heroic BSOD then its also an example of BSoD Song Can result if the hero finds out their close friend Died in Ignorance to a significant truthThe trope is named in honor of the infamous Microsoft Windows error that indicates that the system has screwed itself big time the technical term is stop error A particularly literal version could involve a character preferably a supercomputer or other Artificial Intelligence

Nice Job Breaking It Hero,Congratulations Mickey youve just created The Blot Now just wait until you try to fix your mistakeHow kind of you to open that lock for me Every time I wonder if it was wise to let you live you do something like this and show me youre worth keeping around— Thot Trel Star Trek OnlineThe hero has accomplished their goal theyve killed the Big Bad or defeated them forever or at least scored a major blow against the antagonist Theyve done what they set out to dobut not so fast It turns out that by the very act of success theyve unwittingly made things worse Maybe the nowdead antagonist was actually holding back an even greater evil Maybe the villain having been defeated or damaged is now transformed into a new ultimate unstoppable invincible angry form often against the villains will Maybe the villain despite their villainy was serving some other greater good  keeping the worlduniversenaturewhatever politically or literally balanced  and their demise throws things into chaos Maybe the socalled villain was actually a Hero Antagonist and you just unwittingly handed a huge victory to the real villain Maybe that princess you saved is a coldhearted tyrant at the head of an oppressive regime or even a Sealed Evil in a Can Perhaps taking down the villain has resulted in an Evil Power Vacuum and now even worse guys are fighting to fill the void that the previous villain left causing even more havoc than that previous villain could have ever dreamed Or perhaps the only means of foiling the villain involves questionably massive collateral damage and is so extreme that the hero is now the worst example of He Who Fights Monsters My God What Have I Done or FullCircle Revolution For whatever reason the heros victory over death and destruction directly or indirectly leads to an even greater wave of death and destruction or something else that puts a Downer Ending spin on everything Oh dearMaybe the villain themselves will warn the hero about the possible consequences as a lastditch attempt to save their own skin or as a bitter parting shot to ruin the heros victory You fools do you even know what youve done Villains being villains this may just be a bluff Or maybe the villain will just lament over how the hero defeated them despite all their efforts  it wasnt some sort of plan of theirs for the hero to win and thus make things worse if it was thatd be My Death Is Just the Beginning Then again Poor Communication Kills often comes into play as the villain will usually be uselessly vague and give no concrete reason for why foiling him would be bad On the other other hand a clear warning might be taken as Cassandra Truth anyway You cant winIf the mission was a rescue it was an Unwanted Rescue and the former captive may bitterly inform them of the true factsIn most cases of course the hero will take full responsibility for their actions and be haunted by them horribly traumatized Now their new mission is to stop the new danger theyve unleashed preferably in a way that doesnt spawn ever greater menaces Darker plotlines may end the story right there instead and its always possible the villains demise inadvertently resulted in the irreversible destruction or horrifying mutation of the world If used excessively this trope often leaves an audience with a sense that the hero shouldnt have tried to change things for the better and indeed shouldnt have even left home Can also be a moral about getting seriously involved in things without learning much about themThis trope can be annoying in video games as oftentimes Stupidity Is the Only Option particularly in the case of a MacGuffin Delivery Service It is not particularly fair to try to make the player feel guilty about a course of action they had no control over and indeed mightve gotten a Game Over if they attempted to not fulfill the objectives in questionThe term Pyrrhic Victory has the same connotation and originated from the Pyrrhic War fought by King Pyrrhus in 279 BC which makes Nice Job Breaking It Hero Older Than Feudalism The tropes overlap but Pyrrhic Victory is when someone succeeds at their goal with a very high price while Nice Job Breaking It Hero includes actions that might not be necessary or even intentional In addition this trope sometimes results in no victory at all not even a Pyrrhic oneSometimes a badly thoughtout plot for the sake of action has exactly the same effect when Fridge Logic catches its tail Thats one of the reasons why a good Game Master habit is writing the plot starting from the what happens if Player Characters arent here at all or do nothing pointThis trope is a common problem with the Small Steps Hero Compare Create Your Own Villain What the Hell Hero Unwitting Pawn Must Make Amends You Already Changed the Past Two Rights Make a Wrong Nice Job Fixing It Villain but note that villains are also subject to this trope  they can do something careless that screws them over or helps out a worse villain Compare We Want Our Jerk Back when the herovillain makes the villainhero powerless only to have it backfire and give them a worse villainherofate than expected resulting in them wanting things to go back the way they were Better the Devil You Know is a similar situation where the utter defeat of one villain can lead to a completely different and greater evil taking over This trope may lead to a Redemption Quest in an attempt to make up for the mistake Has very little to do with Nice Job Breaking It Herod in fact that one usually leads to the biggest cases of the complete opposite TropeHitlers Time Travel Exemption Act in certain cases is a SubTrope of this See also Had to Come to Prison to Be a Crook which is this as applied to a legal system Or at least a

Maurice Chevalier Accent,FYI Avoir le cafardnote to have the cockroach is an idiom meaning feeling depressedWe do not even have a language Just a stupid accent Shes right We all talk like Maurice Chevalier Honhonhon— Mel Brooks History of the World Part IActor and singer Maurice Chevalier was the first French entertainer who became an international superstar after he moved to Hollywood His fame and long career made him the most famous and easily recognized Frenchman of the 20th century So whenever comedians or even serious actors had to portray an archetypical Frenchman they imitated Chevaliers voice which had a heavy French accent A Stock Parody that is still in vogue today even though most comedians and audiences have no idea where this stereotype originated fromThe Maurice Chevalier accent is a typical Funny Foreigner subtrope especially whenever a story is set in France All these French characters talk in the same way the and this are pronounced zee and zis The w is pronounced ooweee Some Gratuitous French words mais oui sacrebleu zut alors mon ami or mon chéri are used nonstop Theres often a grotesque emphasis on the final syllable of the last word in a sentence for instance Zis is veiry importààààààànt Chevaliers iconic hon hon hon Signature Laugh has also become the standard way Frenchmen laugh in Englishspeaking fictionNowadays the Maurice Chevalier Accent is used to voice many French characters in Englishspeaking media In comedy and animation this can be amusing but in serious stories it becomes Just a Stupid Accent and can really take you out of the story because it literally becomes ridiculous Poirot Speak In fact whenever a comedic accent is needed you can rest assured that it will usually be French It gets to the point of overkill Sometimes like in the movie Shrek where the British character Robin Hood inexplicably speaks English with a French accentnote This may be explained by the fact that Robin Hood was a Norman people are depicted as being French for no apparent reason other than evoking laughs while using the accentThe accent is a bit Truth in Television for most Frenchmen whose English is not yet that fluent though everyone who tries to speak a language that isnt his own will have problems mastering it Ironically enough even Maurice Chevalier himself lost his native accent after a while and sounded more like a normal English speaking man Only in his early Hollywood years it was very rusty but he also played it up for the microphone and cameras because he was usually typecast as the archetypical Frenchman and thus had to sound like an authentic Frenchman who didnt speak English that fluentlyAlmost always applies for people who live in Gay Paree Compare with Mock Cousteau whenever a scene takes place underwaterIt may be worth pointing out that this trope is even more unrealistic when the French speaker in question is from Quebec Québécois Francophones have markedly different accents in English than people from France for example th tends to be alveolarized turning this thing into dis ting rather than zis sing Giving a Quebec character this accent as some films and movies have piles Cultural Blending on top of it especially if the character is also supplied with a beret Gauloises etcnote Obviously you can meet people in Quebec with a France French accent  lots of people from France have moved there especially in recent years  but not people culturally from Quebec,3420
Police Are Useless,Hitting on a girl while people shoot at each other is definitely the responsible thing for a cop to doCriminals are stupid and Im always one step behind them— Officer Don 3rd Rock from the SunWhenever someone in film or on TV reports a murder or a monster or a stalker or whatever the police come as close to ignoring them as procedure and the local captain will allow And thats if the report is from a respected professional if theyre an Agent Mulder or worse yet a teenager the cops might try to pin charges on themIn addition to police this trope also covers the security guards watchmen the coast guard depending on whether they are given such powers under a civilianmilitaryparamilitary structure and other people whose job is to protect othersnote Or arrestpunish lawbreakers in an official capacity In childrens shows it is related to Adults Are Useless They might not even make it to the police station but just correctly assume that no one would believe themThe usual reason for this trope is that the story would take a boring turn if the cops turned up within 10 minutes and solved the problem Having an Amateur Sleuth story is only possible if the police cant quite get the job done There wouldnt be anything left for the amateur to do if the police solved everything otherwise In such stories the police the amateur has to deal with will be at best an Inspector Lestrade and at worst an Obstructive Bureaucrat Interestingly the trope tends be averted in police comedies because audiences may feel uncomfortable laughing at a police force that lets the bad guys get away So police comedies may feature blundering cops but they will still catch the bad guys in the end Furthermore a Cop Show or Police Procedural will avert this trope more often than notA common interpretation of this trope is merely people not knowing how law enforcement actually works — this was part of why Police Quest was considered one of the most realistic games at the time it was made because you actually couldnt just take what you thought was the obvious solution because it was either illegal incredibly dangerous or both Even law enforcement has to follow the law despite some exceptions and what those games of cops and robbers may tell you Many times the most obvious solution is actually a pretty good way to get yourself or others hurt or killedThe Awful Truth is this happens in real life Police are more often than not just everyday people who want to get through their jobs yet have to maintain very high standards when carrying out their work Police going after the wrong guy Everyone will find themselves wanting to take shortcuts at work In policing a shortcut would mean pinning a crime on the guy right in front of you rather than to try and catch the real bad guy who could be anywhere Also a lot of police departments measure officer performance by the number of arrests they have made and actions they have done That can give incentives for officers to arrest the wrong guy or avoid doing things to prevent crime which is generally agreed to be better than cleaning up after it This can be portrayed sympathetically protagonist is convincingly framed by the real villains as well as negatively Police being corrupt If criminals like Al Capone can bribe their way out of arrest chances are theyre not much use Police being prejudiced If prejudice exists in a society it probably exists in the police This is a problem in many countries with victims of Profiling and Police Brutality most often being those the cops are prejudiced against This may overlap with lazy in cases where the police simply blame the usual suspects from the disliked group rather than put any real effort into investigations Police being lazy This image is common in the United States where every town has to employ its own officers and therefore have enough to respond on a busy day Some things police do in Real Life understandably seem lazy or useless to outside observers too when they actually arent — like sitting in their car eating donutsnote as anyone who has worked any security can tell you this is a side effect of having a job where most of it is waiting for something to happen as opposed to jobs where earning money is dependent on action or a crowd of them arriving and standing around for a simple traffic stop — you cant like a quiet day at your job send police home just because no one is breaking the law — they still may be needed at a moments notice The police arent allowed to help Call the police is not a viable solution to every problem There are rules defining what the police can and cannot do and breaking those rules will at best lead to the police being chewed out by a judge while the person they took action against is let go And if the police refuse to intervene in what is really a petty dispute between two citizens rather than a serious crime you will be getting chewed out instead They have more important things to do than act as your personal hall monitors after all Police being underfunded or overworked On the flipside another common image is that the police are so busy and understaffed that they cant effectively deal with crime Some places have police forces that definitely suffer from chronic underfunding and even wellfunded ones are never really satisfied with the level of funding and resources they have In the United States cops can be portrayed as being both lazy or overworked In sparsely populated small towns chances are greater that the police arent numeroustrainedequipped enough but this is sometimes true of even bigcity law enforcement who have to deal with a lot of stuff on a daytoday basis Police being hopelessly outmatched The criminals are just too much for the police to handle Perhaps organized crime is effectively in charge perhaps society is breaking down and nobody is really in charge perhaps the setting is one where some of the criminals are monsters evil wizards zombies supervillains etc On a more normal level it can be as simple as that the criminals are better equipped and armed than the police which does sometimes occur in real life toonote One example would be the North Hollywood shootout in 1997 where two bank robbers in full body armor and armed with automatic weapons got into a shootout with police mostly without armor and armed with only 9mm38 pistols that lasted over a half hour and saw over 2000 rounds exchanged because the pistol rounds werent enough to take down the robbers This incident along with the 911 attacks and a huge surplus of military equipment is why many police departments are now as well armed as an infantry unit and why many police now keep an AR15 style rifle in their patrol car Police being generally incompetent And of course finally some are just standardissue bumblers Also eating all those donuts could be making them braindead sleepy and too obese to actually be of any use But thats America for you In some cases the police just dont bother intervening with crime because they find it boring Police work for the criminals Often the police are actually The Dragon to the villains of the story Police are the villains Here youre really in trouble as the police or some of them at least are themselves the bad guys While honest cops in the story may exist as well youll probably have a difficult time convincing them of what has been going on or proving it legally especially as the villains will doubtless use their own status and knowledge to get away with any crimes theyve committed There are no police the bottom line None think the police could help because either the police is REALLY not there or the characters will assume its normal for them to ignore the police and just carry on with the story Sometimes one or some of the aforementioned reasons are vaguely or insufficently implied and thats itSee also The Only One and Bad CopIncompetent Cop though they are not necessarily incompetent it may just be that the calls are too nonsensical to be believed by someone who doesnt know theyre in a show You Have to Believe Me occurs when the police dont believe the person because the person is presenting their case in a fashion where no reasonable person would believe them No Police Option is a more realistic spin where the police arent allowed to resolve the problem even if they do believe the person whos asking for their help Lawful Pushover and Lemming Cops are other related tropes Contrast I Fought the Law and the Law Won as well as The Men in Black who do believe your reports of ghostsmonsterswhatever and probably know more about them than you do but are still bad news and Militaries Are Useless when the authorities from the military side do try to help but fail for dramatic tension and The Lopsided Arm of the Law where the police withholds its competency and firepower with little if any explained reason until someone tries to take the law into their own hands and then they unleash said resources to hunt them and only them down If the police are lazy this trope can overlap with Lethal NegligenceFor the complete opposite see Police Brutality though they can easily be combined — Bad CopIncompetent Cop being one example where some cops are brutal and some are useless and some are both and cops who are brutal but also useless — as in the people they beat up and kill are innocent while real criminals escape because they know how to look like they play by the rules When its police driving ability thats in question see Hollywood Police Driving Academy Subtrope of Artistic License  Law Enforcement,9535

AntiVillain,Vlad was one of those oldtime bad guys with honor and morals which made him almost one of the good guys None of us was a saint— Max Max PayneAn AntiVillain is the opposite of an AntiHero  a character with heroic goals personality traits andor virtues who is ultimately the villain Their desired ends are mostly good but their means of getting there range from evil to undesirable Alternatively their goals may be selfish or have longterm consequences they dont care about but theyre good people who might even team up with the hero if their goals dont conflictThey often reach a kind of critical mass that makes them more good than normal villains but not quite heroes blurring the line between hero and villain the same way an AntiHero does but coming from the opposite directionAntiVillain is an attempt to lighten up a villain as opposed to an AntiHero which has a tendency to darken the hero Side by side it can become very hard to tell them apart The only reason some would even be considered evil at all is when theyre the Designated Villain Despite this humanizing characterization they are rarely less dangerous For instance heroes wouldnt know what to expect if their enemy shows caring and then attacks their reputation without giving them an excuse to rationalize killing themMost of them are probably well aware that what theyre doing is evil unlike the blinded Knight Templar but strive to maintain a façade of good PR often by engaging in Pragmatic Villainy Theyll see it as a viable means to a possibly good endIn terms of personality antivillains are kindhearted and can be caring and honorable in nature even towards their enemies but it can be possible for them to treat their own allies with rudeness which by its own accord is a very unusual trait to possess Moreover compared to regular villains that are just simply evil antivillains are often neutral — depending on the writers of said characters Those that are part of the neutral alignments however arent exactly benevolent but they arent malevolent either but there also do exist antivillains that are outright evil in nature though they still maintain all of the attributes that antivillains usually have in common They can also be capable of a HeelFace Turn much more easily than normal villains thanks to their personalitiesIt may also be possible to turn a normal villain into an AntiVillain over time by detailing their Start of Darkness giving them a Cynicism Catalyst a Morality Pet multiple Pet the Dog episodes or otherwise retconning them into submission A Freudian Excuse may explain their actions but almost never changes them into an AntiVillain if there is nothing good about their present motivationsCompare and contrast this trope with its antithesis the AntiHero A character who is a Wild Card or a HeelFace Revolving Door can be capable of being both an AntiHero and an AntiVillain depending on whether or not they are acting for or against the protagonist at the time They are often the sympathetic party of a Sympathetic Villain Despicable Villain duoThese characters fall under villians we sympathize with on the Sliding Scale of Character AppreciationImportant A Complete Monster can never qualify as an AntiVillain because their causes are never noble even if they claim otherwise and are not meant to be sympathetic in any way whereas you are supposed to relate to if not sympathize with an AntiVillain despite otherwise not approving their methods it is possible for a character that formerly qualified as an AntiVillain to be a Complete Monster however if they remove all their redeemable or sympathetic characteristics,3624

Its All About Me,And this perfect world will spin about his every little whim because this perfect world begins and ends with ME BOOM BABYFry Bender this has nothing to do with you Bender Thats impossible— Futurama Jurassic BarkAh the EgoThe part of the psyche that defines you as an individual and considers itself read you a separate entity from the rest of nature and even the entire cosmos the ego encourages people to value themselves as well as their personal wants and needs instead of just being an Extreme Doormat While necessary in moderation allowing ones ego to become overinflated leads to selfcentered and downright embarrassing behavior Such an excess of selfimportance can be called egotismThe egotist seems to think that the world ought to revolve around them and their every little whim and is ready to walk all over other people in order to get what they want They expect others to wait upon them hand and foot make way for them on the sidewalk or let them cut ahead in line help them first even if there are other people in greater need and sacrifice their own best interests for whatever the egotist demands They dont care about how their actions might harm other people yet display Moral Myopia when someone else does something to harm or inconvenience them If they do understand that the world doesnt revolve around them theyll see this as a bad thing in need of rectifyingExactly why they think theyre important and everyone else isnt will vary from case to case For some it could be the belief that theyre superior to normal people because they are more beautiful talented favored by a deity etc—which may or may not be true—while others are simply so lacking in empathy that they cant imagine anyone elses pain or feelings being as real as theirs On the highest end of the ego scale is a terrifying form of Obliviously Evil when the egotist is unable to comprehend that theyre doing anything immoral because they are unable to comprehend that other people have feelings at allnote Obliviously Evil villains are usually sympathetic AntiVillains but villains whose obliviousness are derived from their inability to comprehend that other people even have feelings eg Judge Claude Frollo and Shou Tucker are usually even viler Selfishness is a big part of the definition but even beyond that an egotist thinks of themself as being the focus of everything that anyone else does They assume that everyone knows who they are and what they can do which might be plausible if they are actually important wealthy or famous but becomes Small Name Big Ego if they are actually much less special than they think If anybody fails to recognize them or treat them like royalty they feel intentionally snubbed or insulted Whats more if they end up as collateral damage of someone elses scheme or even just an honest mistake they interpret it as a conspiracy to harm or humiliate them specifically This is despite their own tendency to forget the names and faces of little people who they consider beneath them and to say But for Me It Was Tuesday when they cant remember a person they mistreatedIts hard or impossible for them to imagine that other people have their own lives outside of interacting with them Not only must their friends family and adoring public be thinking about them all the time but their rivals or enemies are surely out there obsessing about how to bring them down no doubt because theyre jealous of the egoists style and success An egoist whos an Attention Whore or a CardCarrying Villain might go so far as to think theres No Such Thing as Bad Publicity since the only thing worse than being talked about negatively is not being talked about at all An egotist with delusions of grandeur may have a onesided rivalry or hatred for a different character who hardly even notices them If normal criticisms fail to work on an egoist because they lack any sense of morality or shame the most effective tactics for deliberately getting a rise out of them are mocking how pathetic and ridiculous they are calling them boring or giving them a The Reason You Suck Speech about how theyre delusional to think theyre so importantA healthy ego exults the strengths of an individual in an overt way which—on balance—can benefit everyone An unchecked ego however is mainly preoccupied with blocking out unacceptable thoughts that are hurtful or belittling to itself even tuning out the entire world if necessary Toddlers have this attitude by default as their brains are not developed enough to understand that other

Firing Day, At least theres no ambiguityA sacking the book says is one of the most harrowing and stressful events you may ever experience — Jones assumes you means the person being sacked until he realizes its talking about the manager According to the book sackings can be highly destabilizing workers stop thinking about doing their jobs and start thinking about whether theyll still have them  What Jones doesnt find in the book — and he doesnt notice this at first he has to flick back and forth — is any mention of the retrenched employees  Its almost as if once they are sacked they cease to exist— Jones reading the Omega Management System Company by Max BarryBeing fired is one of the most traumatic experiences a person can go through Not only do they lose their livelihood their circle of work friends and their routine but they have to deal with the fact that somebody looked them in the eye and said Youre not good enough Or maybe even worse Didnt look them in the eye and just sent a dismissal letter or email as though they werent worth the personal appearanceHarshBut its not always easy on the person doing the firing either They need to be the one who looks the other person in the eye and says Youre not good enough and then they need to live with the guilt afterwards How do you just go back to your 9to5 job after you made the calculated decision that somebody wasnt worth keeping aroundWhether youre the fireer or the fireee its a serious event with longlasting repercussionsStories that focus on the person being fired can approach it in multiple different ways If the character knows its coming they can play up the fear and dread as the deadline approaches In a comedy this can be the impetus for a Zany Scheme to try and save their job or perhaps a form of revenge against the company instead If it is a surprise it can serve as a Cruel Twist Ending to shock and dismay the audience If the character is a main character in an ongoing story they will often have their job again the next week but not always Sometimes this leads to an entirely new story or arc Occasionally the firing will be seen as a good thing giving the character the impetus to pursue the dreams that they had been putting offStories which focus on the person performing the firing dont have as much leeway and instead have one predominant feature Forcing the character to shoulder the responsibility of firing somebody Normally this will be their very first firing and will come after a recent promotion to highlight the burdens that come with the perks of management It might also be somebody they were friends with or had previously hired to add emotional complexity Normally they want desperately to be a Benevolent Boss only to ultimately find that there is no way around the issue in the cutanddry world of dollars and centsIf the person doing the firing is a supervillain or criminal of some kind this might overlap with You Have Failed Me or You Have Outlived Your Usefulness Related to Kicked Upstairs and Reassigned to Antarctica where they try to get rid of somebody without firing them,3081

Class Trip,You only wish real ones were this awesomeKevin All riiight field trip Where we goin Daria The field Kevin Cool— DariaAny series that takes place in a school be it elementary middle high or even kindergarten will have at least one episode that takes place during a class trip The destination can vary but for day trips its usually educational and painfully boring like a museum a local historical landmark or a cardboard box factory Kyoto is one of the most common destinations for these in Japanese MediaA whole episode Class Trip is a great change of scenery and gives both an interesting place to cook up wacky hijinks and a watershed moment in romantic relationships between students Its technically Not a Date but it gives couples a chance to sneak off and go sightseeing by themselves The travel itself can be a bit of an adventure and once the class gets there there are endless opportunities for Zany Schemes illicit romance or mistaken assumptions that zany schemes and illicit romance are happening Its an excellent time for a First Kiss to happen Or for a lost Monster of the Week to attack,1100

Sudden Anatomy,Even The Noseless will grow nostrils if the stench is bad enoughOn the one hand Noah is right On the other hand Duncan is right suddenly has a third hand On the third hand hey Whose hand is that— Owen Total DramaRamaIn a lot of comics and animation the anatomy of living creatures tends to be simplified in a variety of ways Some of these are common such as people not having any discernible lips Others are more unique to their artists or characters like how The Powerpuff Girls are drawn without any fingersHowever sometimes the piece of anatomy thats usually missing becomes important to the story and so a character will suddenly gain that piece of anatomy for exactly as long as they need it For example if characters in a series dont usually have lips theyll suddenly sprout a pair if they need to kiss someone Or if theyre normally drawn without eyebrows but theyre doing a Spock imitation theyll suddenly grow some just for the Fascinating Eyebrow moment Characters without eyelashes may sprout a pair to flutter Characters with Black Bead Eyes may suddenly grow sclerae and irises whenever shocked or angry One of the most common is characters with FourFingered Hands suddenly gaining a fifth finger especially in closeupsDepending on how entrenched the art style is in the audiences mind this can seem rather jarring And sometimes thats actually the desired effectContrast Invisible Anatomy when body parts functions even without being shown,1451
Lazy Bum,Joe I could do a lot of things if it was necessary Queenie Then why dont you Joe It aint necessary— Show Boat 1936A Lazy Bum is very rare Just ask anybody if theyre lazy They may be Brilliant but Lazy or Book Dumb or shrewdly saving their energy but theyre not just plain lazy They work hard really or at least they could if it was worth the effort to do it but theyre not lazy The only people who think they arent working are their fascist bosses Got it In fact if you asked these hardworking people about their coworkers youd realize that theyre the only ones who do any work around hereOf course every now and then you get a Lazy Bum who is more selfaware These tend to be Smug Snakes who think its hilarious that other people bother to do work instead of just leeching Then there are the ones who are really selfaware and almost philosophically devoted to being lazy They scheme so hard at getting out of work that its actually harder work than just doing the work Usually their boss is a humorless Control Freak who is so annoying that we root for the worthless slacker insteadA more metaphorical example of this trope would be moral laziness Usually seen in villains antiheroes and antivillains this type of laziness applies to those who take the easy way out in a psychological sense Usually this includes murder being an Extreme Doormat allowing oneself to be easily manipulated lacking empathy toward others or just lacking the drive and willpower to say noThen there are the ones who are supposed to be sympathetic because theyre just like you These may be the most common type of all and theres probably others but its too much work to write about them No doubt Wiki Magic will take care of itBeing a Lazy Bum — whether in the traditional sense or the metaphorical one of moral laziness — is also known as Sloth which is one of the Seven Deadly Sins Not to be confused with the South American mammal which is named sloth because it sleeps a lot and moves very slowly even when its awake Compare The SlackerSubtropes include Ambitious but Lazy Beauty Breeds Laziness Cats Are Lazy LaidBack Koala Lazy Dragon and Sluggish Seal If someones laziness gets someone harmed or killed it is a case a Lethal Negligence,2219
Improvised Imprisonment,Brannigan Throw her in the brig Fry We dont have a brig Brannigan Then throw her in the laundry room which will hereafter be referred to as the brig— Futurama Brannigan Begin AgainSometimes characters decide one of their own is too dangerous or too rebellious to be kept around but arent in a position where they can get help from the proper authorities nor are they able or willing to just kill them and end it directly Maybe theyre isolated or already acting outside the law or maybe theyre just in a situation too dire or complicated to get anyone else involvedThe obvious solution then is to just throw the enemy into a room any room and treat them as a prisoner There wont be any proper guarding or concern for the ethics or legality of the situation they need a quick fix that keeps their enemy isolated and this is the way to do it In some cases they wont even be in a prison at all or maybe they wont have anyone bothering to guard them The prisoner is locked away or chained to a post somewhere problem solved right Now they can just wait for help to arrive or figure out where to go from here without worrying about some traitor or villain causing issues for themThis can signify a few things about the characters and situation Theyre usually in a state of desperation and looking for an easy solution to a dire problem Theyre rarely portrayed as villains as the motivation is usually about trying to isolate someone whos dangerous and could hurt people but that doesnt mean the act isnt still pragmatic or Anti Heroic The characters might also be seen as sloppy or amateurish especially since theres a lot of ways this sort of thing can backfirePrisoners can escape pretty easily considering nobody in the situation is usually trained to stand guard over dangerous entities Alternatively the imprisoners might only intend to use this as step one and have darker plans in mind later which takes this from desperate but wellintended to outright vigilante justice Oh and theres never a guarantee the prisoner will be guilty such a set up is already indicative of sloppy planning or a general lack of experience which can easily cause innocents to get imprisoned by mistakeA Furniture Blockade may be used for this Can overlap with Too Desperate to Be Picky if the situation is so dire that they need a quick solution regardless of how wellthoughtout it is Compare and Contrast the AntiInterference Lock Up which can also involve characters being held up in random places but with much different motivation and outcomes,2526
Breakfast in Bed,How did you get in my houseDorien Can I smell a full English breakfast Sharon Traceys just had it in bed Dorien With whom Tracey On my own Youre a trollop you are— Birds of a Feather An Inspector StaysBreakfast in Bed is a largely Western European and American concept rooted in privilege and indulgence Originally affluent married women who had the luxury of servants in their home would be allowed to enjoy breakfast in their sleeping quarters while men would start the day eating breakfast in the family room or drawing room Over time however the concept has evolved into more of a way for people to pamper a loved one as a show of appreciation or affectionIn fiction while breakfast in bed may still be occasionally observed as a perk for the Idle Rich as it traditionally was more often than not the trope will indicate a goodwill gesture to loved onesUsually characters will wake a loved one in bed and serve them breakfast for a special occasion such as children making breakfast for a parent to celebrate Mothers Day Fathers Day or their birthday Alternatively a man may serve breakfast in bed to his wife or girlfriend on a Valentines Day or anniversarySimilarly it may be part of a morning ritual between a new romantic couple after their first night together whoever is playing host for their new partner will likely be up early to make breakfast in bed for the other person unless of course it turns out that person was Not Staying for Breakfast A Downplayed take on this variant will often involve serving and drinking morning cups of coffee in bedBreakfast in Bed will be frequently served on a special tray with legs that raise it over the consumers lap Bonus points to be awarded if the server adorned the tray with a single flower in a small vaseEven with the best of intentions there is still plenty that can go wrong for comedys sake especially in a family setting where the mother is typically the one who does all the cooking and yet is most often the one to be served her own breakfast in bed Since Dads Cant Cook and kids are rarely any better its an impressive feat unto itself if Mom is competently served anything that isnt buttered toast or cold cerealIn Real Life luxury hotels serve fancy breakfast in bed by room service The breakfast comes on a tray with a metal dome over the food to keep it warm The breakfast may include freshly baked pastries tarts and bread cut fruit savory items freshsqueezed juice or a smoothie and coffee along with regional specialtiesSister Trope to Romantic Candlelit Dinner,2534
Be Yourself,The true moral of this story farts are funnyI praise You for I am awesomely wondrously made Your work is wonderful I know it very well My frame was not concealed from You when I was shaped in a hidden place knit together in the recesses of the earth Your eyes saw my unformed limbs they were all recorded in Your book in due time they were formed to the very last one of them— Psalm 1391416 The Biblebecause everyone else is takenBe Yourself is a popular trope especially in shows aimed at children One character tries to persuade another character to change their image and not be a loser geek etc After the change goes amiss Flowers for Algernon Syndrome almost always ensues and An Aesop is delivered about how it is better to be true to ones own nature rather than putting on a facade to impress others Usually that means being behind the times unfashionable out of shape handicapped overweight uncool a complete and utter failure socially inept and that especially means being that guy Being oneself also requires a person to live below his or her full potential Its one of the most frequently broken Aesops tying in to the Status Quo Is God mindsetIf this trope is played well it can carry the message that you can be worthy of love and acceptance without sacrificing the things that make you who you are and to value your unique traits rather than hide them to fit in but if done poorly or too often the message can imply that any kind of personal growth and self improvement are bad and you must never try a new look pick up new interests or make new friends Or worse that you should be a Jerkass rather than work to become a better person Bonus points if a Subculture of the Week is featured to try to sway our hero to their sideThe Easily Embarrassed Youngster often learns this one If the trope succeeds it may lead to said character declaring I Am What I Am,1869

Rejected Apology,I said its too late to apologize— Apologize by OneRepublicBob did something terrible to Alice He feels guilty so he gives her a sincere apology However Alice wont have it She doesnt care about the apology Whether Bobs actions were that bad or Alice is just a plain Jerkass who holds grudges she refuses to forgive himThis results from someone holding a grudge that they refuse to let go of Unfortunately this can make out someone who has a rightful reason to be angry into a cruel person if the apologizing party is sincerely guilty for their actions On the other hand it may not take away much if any sympathy at all if the person whos apologizing has committed wicked deeds that were too numerous or too horrible to deserve forgiveness and in extreme cases can even make the apologizer look like a total selfish jerk for thinking one sorry is enough to make up for a lifetime of atrocities especially if said apology was disproportionate and halfhearted There are times when even the apologies themselves could be an even bigger insult than the original offense especially if they believe a single apology will undo all damages It could even be the victim knows the person is only apologizing because they are trying to convince the victim not to punish them for their actions and the person isnt honestly sorry for what they didIn a rare occurrence sometimes the rejected apology was coerced by outside parties In the event of this the one apologizing is shown as more sympathetic due to receiving harsh treatment from both sides and the rejecter is portrayed as even more jerkish and completely unreasonable however fair that may be In some cases however the fact that the apology was clearly enforced and not sincere is exactly why it was rejected In really tearjerking occasions the incident that led to the rejecter being angry was a complete misunderstanding but the rejecter refuses to listen to or maybe even believe the apologizing partys explanation In more extreme cases the rejecter might even turn down the apology while on the rejecters deathbed to deliberately spite the one apologizing with PartingWords RegretThe opposite of Redemption Rejection where the one who did wrong is offered a chance to be forgiven but he turns it down A super trope of Reformed but Rejected An extreme version of this trope is HeelFace DoorSlam which happens if rejecting an apology also involves killing the offender Contrast Easily Forgiven where its a character forgiving those who dont apologize for their actions Sometimes the victim gives a Flippant Forgiveness where the victim accepts their offenders apology in a sarcastic insulting way If the character does accept their apology but is still upset by their actions then its Forgiven but Not Forgotten Contrast The Unapologetic where the wrongdoer refuses to apologize for this case having their apology rejected or knowing that it will be rejected by the other party can be a reason why they refuse to apologize especially if they know deep down theyre not truly sorry for what theyve done See No Sympathy for Grudgeholders where this may or may not be a fitting response to the characters lack of forgiveness This can often be part of the The Reason You Suck Speech if the rejection is extremely harsh Virtue Is Weakness might come to play in that the rejecter might see forgiveness as a sign of weakness If the apologizer acts equally standoffish and recants their apology after being rejected either due to arrogantly expecting forgiveness or hypocrisy on the refusers end Then Let Me Be Evil is what they may commit Often found in many Downer Endings and few Bittersweet Endings,3641
Villainous Breakdown,Sonicwhat did you do to him I just beat him like always More than that You didnt just beat him this time Sonic You broke himYou have waylaid all his other plans Now as a petulant child he will destroy the game board rather than admit defeat Be ready for anything He still believes himself a god and gods do not fall gracefully— Solas on the Elder One Dragon Age InquisitionHell hath no fury like a villain scornedThis is the tendency of relatively calm and composed villains to lose their cool over the course of the story Usually happens to arrogant Chessmastertype villains especially if said villain is a Smug Snake as control of the situation slips from his or her grasp and things come up that they Didnt See Coming Most notable when it happens towards the end of the story to show how pathetic the Big Bad is when things are not going exactly as planned This Cannot Be Especially apparent if they previously had Creepy Monotone or Dissonant Serenity and suddenly start Chewing the Scenery when they do this because their plan is succeeding it is more of a case of Drunk on the Dark Side Dirty Cowards also suffer from this especially when they are corneredSimilar to Oh Crap though the difference lies in that Oh Crap moments involve a single moment where the character finds that they are screwed while Villainous Breakdowns have them see it coming from miles away The heroic counterpart is the Heroic Safe ModeNote that this isnt necessarily an example of Villain Decay On the contrary some villains become much more terrifying and dangerous when their façade of cunning and civility crumbles They might even end up dishing out a vicious NoHoldsBarred Beatdown to the Heroes engage in some ColdBlooded Torture or goodness forbid drop the Villain Ball and Just FINISH HIM Already instead of playing around It could even lead them to stop holding back their true nature and assuming their true form as the Complete Monster they actually were Thus a Villainous Breakdown is frequently a trigger for a OneWinged Angel transformation Affably Evil and Faux Affably Evil villains are prone to becoming far more terrifying and disturbing when they undergo one of these because their fairly normal personality serve to emphasize their breakdownA somewhat less common but not exactly infrequent form of breakdown results in the exact opposite reaction the villain lapses into a catatonic state as the shock of their defeat robs them of their wits Another form of breakdown occurs due to Heel Realization causing a Villainous BSoD Yet another is the impotent flailing of a defeated villain left with nothing without powerThe scale of the breakdown generally depends on the nature — and overall impressiveness — of the villain A Smug Snake being generally inclined to rate their own abilities higher than everyone around them anyway and less equipped to deal with setbacks will usually break down more frequently and over relatively minor spanners in the works with the resulting tantrum usually being lessthanimpressive A Magnificent Bastard on the other hand is already the type of villain whos not inclined to sweat the small stuff and will usually respond to most setbacks fairly calmly however this merely means that if their plans suffer a particularly impressive implosion then this will usually make their resulting breakdown all the more epic Similarly a relatively minor or smallscale villain may have a breakdown on the level of a temper tantrum or explosive Cluster FBomb rant a major or larger scale villain however will frequently have a breakdown with potentially and quite literally worldending consequences As the old saying goes The bigger you are the harder you fallIn another type the breakdown wont be one sudden explosion but a gradual progression of smaller gradually increasing breakdowns happening over the course of the story As their Evil Plan comes closer to failing or their plans fail again and again they simply get worse and worse as the breakdown continues until finally they lose it completely This normally happens in the buildup to the final confrontation This can overlap with Sanity Slippage where a character gradually becomes more and more insane as time goes on And as a special treat when the villain finally goes so crazy and batshit insane that he completely loses it other characters tend to hit him with a Youre InsaneAnother type of breakdown is when the villain becomes extremely furious when either something happens that isnt part of his plan or his plans end up being ruined or both Once pissed off they may lose their temper and say such phrases as Why Wont You Die Ive had it with you You Monster I shouldve killed you when I had the chance or even This Is Unforgivable Either way the villain will scream more and more at the other characters in fury often in such a high pitch as to sound like a girl especially if theyre male before being bested by them A string of Kick the Dog or Bad Boss moments is another subtle way of indicating this if the villain had previously displayed parentlike feelings toward their henchmenOne specific variation appears in some Video Games where the main villain is able to broadcast messages to the player over the course of the story and they eventually lose it and start broadcasting more and more desperate pleasinsultsbribes to the player as they get closer to themFor Anti Villains or ones with a Freudian Excuse a breakdown can either play Cry for the Devil if their breakdown is pathetic or cement them on the far side of the Moral Event Horizon if they went Jumping Off the Slippery Slope during their breakdown A subversion of this trope is Graceful LoserHeroes have been known to suffer similar breakdowns though unless they are making a Last Stand they are much less likely to die during oneNote that this is usually done in a climax and just the fact that one occurs is a pretty big spoiler so read with cautionSuperTrope to Villainous BSoD Sister Trope to Rage Breaking Point and can often overlap Compare the Villainous RRoD which is where physical overexertion causes the bad guys body to start falling apart Can overlap with Identity Breakdown if the trigger of the villains breakdown are issues or revelations regarding who or what they areNot to Be Confused with Broken Heel which is a literal application of the term,6319
Reasonable Authority Figure,The Governor Parasitic aliens are invading Earth And my husband is controlled by one Marco Yeah Basically thats the story The Governor Thank God I was beginning to think something much much worse was happening Aliens we can fight— Animorphs 51 The AbsoluteHeroes like the Ignored Expert have a hard enough time dealing with idiotic peasants but their deepest problems invariably come from the antagonistic local authorities who are dead set on ignoring their warnings and running them out of town because its politically expedient This makes the existence of the Reasonable Authority Figure all the rarerFully aware that Machiavelli Was Wrong theyll listen to those crazy kids when they say theres a fugitive nearby and logically consider their arguments instead of dismissing them outright However their openness to the heroes ideas doesnt mean theyll follow Agent Mulders crazy ideas blindly Often theyll ask for proof and facts rather than follow baseless accusations but even then theyll usually humor the heroes and go check out their theories whether it pans out or turns into a dead end depends on how far along the story isUsually Lawful Good and the person characters must Bring News Back to They are the chain of command that goes past the basic Command Roster The Rebellious Rebel is motivated by loyalty to himNoteworthy because if the hero does manage to convince them they can help in the fight but they may have to Shoot the Dog as part of their position Being in a position where you are responsible for millions and do not think that A Million Is a Statistic can be hardMay present The Hero and his companions with valuable gifts before The Quest or as a reward afterwardThis position means that they can end the story quickly unless other obstacles intervene Which means they usually do intervene Theyre made inaccessible by the Obstructive Bureaucrat and Evil Chancellor who has it in for the heroes trying to stop them getting an audience or outright lying to destroy their arguments and reputation Barring this the Reasonable Authority Figure might just be busy overworked or underfunded and might not have the time or resources to adequately solve the heros problem as quickly as he or she would like A young ruler usually hereditary may have difficulty either getting to the heroes to listen or asserting his theoretical authority Usually they are surrounded by manipulative guardians out to start pointless wars The Reasonable Authority Figure will inevitably be displaced when a Tyrant Takes the Helm leading to a 10Minute Retirement If he is not the absolute ruler Interservice Rivalry and Divided We Fall can be a problem even after you persuade him Indeed that you speak with this character may induce his rivals to regard you as an enemy or to undercut you in hopes of ensuring that their favorites succeed in your place If he needs approval from the NotSoOmniscient Council of Bickering to take action the chances that he can convince them to agree about anything are less than favorable Despite giving the heroes a fair chance to prove themselves circumstances or bad luck have led to the heroes inability to provide sufficient proof of their claim and the authority figure ultimately refusing to help until better proof can be provided This usually comes with a sympathetic explanation that they want to help but that it would be unreasonable of them to spend so much money or to put others at risk without sufficient proof of the necessity of the action The heros claim appears to be so patently falseunbelievable despite actually being true that the authority figure doesnt believe them for a moment but humours them by at least trying to verify the claim with an obvious lack of success While sympathetic the Reasonable Authority Figures aims do not align with or are in some way opposed to that of the heroes and they are reluctant to help them in a directly meaningful manner without further persuasion After all the RAF has a duty to their faction first regardless of whether the fate of the world is supposedly at stake Of course sometimes the threat is so overwhelmingly catastrophic that even his help merely upgrades the heroes situation from completely hopeless to fighting chanceA common subversion is to have this character turn out to be the Treacherous Advisor Sometimes also they will merely have a Treacherous Advisor and be undermined because they listen to him too muchIt should be noted that a reasonable authority figure isnt somebody who simply says yes to all of their subordinates requests It may be that they have a good reason to deny a request perhaps because it would interfere with the big picture and throw off some other more important task that must be completed or that there is a morally ambiguous situation and while he has sympathy for his subordinates position he cant agree with it due to conflicting ethics This often crops up in To Be Lawful or Good situations It may also be that while he personally believes his staff when they come to him with an outlandish story hes aware that his own superiors may not and would require proof and therefore must refuse their requests on that basis Conversely a leader who lets his subordinates do whatever they please may not be a good leader at all but may be completely ineffectual or even possibly malevolent for example by making his subordinates so loyal to him that they willingly and eagerly hurl themselves into situations for him that more guarded people would realise were insane In other words a reasonable authority figure doesnt always have to support his underlings if he has good reasons not to and somebody who does always back his subordinates up isnt always a reasonable authority figure The key word here is reasonable after all and that means logically assessing a situation and choosing a course of action based on how the available information describes the circumstancesThe types opposite is HeadintheSand Management Also contrast the Clueless Boss who means well but is desperately out of touch with things in his own organization and possibly incompetent If male the Reasonable Authority Figure may be The Patriarch and A Father to His Men or Da Chief or a Benevolent Boss If female the Reasonable Authority Figure may be an Iron Lady or The High QueenIn schooltype

he was angry at and he was taking it out on his men Temple Fugate before becoming the Clock King in Batman The Animated Series Threatening to fire an employee for being five minutes late seems mean to a normal human being but Fugate is a Schedule Fanatic who only cares for punctuality If youre a punctual employee Fugate would be civil to you but never appreciative Rancid Rabbit from CatDog acts as this for whatever job he takes in the episode At his worst he strays over into a fullon Bad Boss but hes also gone PointyHaired Boss in his less antagonistic appearances In Codename Kids Next Door

power although Kif could have acted like this to take his frustrations of Zapp out on Fry Hermes Conrad while not actually the CEO of Planet Express is a beaureaucrat who is sometimes shown to have executive powers such as managing employee wages and on occasion firing people However he is shown to be very mean and abusive towards Zoidberg as Hermes frequently deducts Zoidbergs paychecks for no reasons and often calls him ya filthy crab which is considered to be a racist slur as Zoidberg is a decapodian with crab and lobster like features Grunkle Stan from Gravity Falls made especially

the Mickey Mouse 2013 short Workin Stiff the boss of Company Industries counts as one as he is willing to let people like Goofy apply to be a live crash test dummy to crash test turbo chairs Principal Pixiefrog from My Gym Partners a Monkey at his worst though hes usually more of a PointyHaired Boss The Little Man from The Pink Panther whenever he has a boss role that is Lieutenant Harris in Police Academy The Animated Series as his movie counterpart is a terrible person and the inmediate superior of most of the cast Downplayed with the existence of Cmndt Lazard who is a nice guy and Harris superior Benson from Regular Show Though to be fair Benson just has to deal with slackers like Mordecai and Rigby Muscle Man sometimes gets on his nerves as well Hes actually quite reasonable with Pops and Skips But from the point of view of the actual protagonists Benson is a prick who takes away anything that gives the two the slightest joy in any given episode and then threatens to fire them Bensons own boss Mr Maellard is definitely this being far meaner to him than Benson is to Mordecai and Rigby Rockos boss Mr Smitty from Rockos Modern Life Likewise Mr Bigheads boss Mr Dupette sometimes strays into Bad Boss given that hes sorta like Mr Burns as an anthropomorphic lizard and owns OTown though unlike Mr Smitty hes depicted as much nicer in some of his appearances in the final season Mr Krabs of SpongeBob SquarePants can be one on his bad days He would often yell at his employees SpongeBob and Squidward whenever theyre screwing things up in the Krusty Krab or whenever theyre goofing off from working which is something SpongeBob can attest to for the most part Krusty the Clown from The Simpsons while not a Bad Boss as Mr Burns is has a history of dealing out abuse and disrespect to his supporting players or Sideshows both onscreen and off to the point of providing the Start of Darkness for the previous one Sideshow Bob When Bart goes to work for him in Bart Gets Famous he finds out just how bad it gets Downplayed with Bull Gator of TazMania Hes very amicable and pleasant towards his sidekick Axel but he wont hesitate to club Axel if the other reptile

The Dreaded,They should have fledKeaton always said I dont believe in God but Im afraid of Him Well I do believe in God and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Söze— Verbal Kint The Usual SuspectsA villain or AntiHero whose primary characteristic is the fear the other side has of themTo be the Dreaded a character has to be far and away the most feared person in the story These are people who make you quail not because of anything they are doing at that moment but simply because you know who they are and what theyre capable of and sometimes the latter part is optional Maybe this character has a reputation as a Hero Killer a person who kills the other sides strongest and noblest supporters Maybe they use fear as a magical effect which triggers panic in others Maybe theyve done so many horrible things that nobody ever wants to speak of them again Maybe they are simply so mindbreakingly horrible even the strongest of hearts falter But the defining trait of the Dreaded is that they are feared Probably has a scary name unless they use a really scary alias instead If their ability in combat lives up to their reputation then the only choice one has when facing them may be to Run or Die Whenif the Dreaded character dies their death will almost certainly be followed by much rejoicingif theyre actually dead that isOne of the characters biggest advantages is how the terror they inspire in their opponents undermines the foes ability and willingness to fight If they end up fighting someone who is not afraid of them the Dreadeds opponent might actually be able to fight them more evenlyAlthough there are exceptions particularly on the other side of the fence a key characteristic of this trope tends to be invisibility In general characters—villains in particular—who conform to this trope will not be seen directly the first few times they are mentioned The show will tend to work on building up their perceived threat in the minds of the audience a dark shadowy something thats out there somewhere but you dont know where who or what they are or even whether or not they can be killed at least at first As such it usually involves acceptable forms of Character Shilling It is possible for them to remain this trope after they come out of the shadows but if they do not then beware Villain DecayAdditionally there is a heroic equivalent called the Terror Hero when there is a hero so renowned that the enemy would rather flee than possibly encounter them They tend to be antiheroes of some kind though ranging from grades 24 due to audiences seldom associating dread as an emotion a pure hero inspires Some criminals also tend to go for this in order to prevent anyone from informing on themNote that it isnt the audiences reaction to the Dreaded that matters but the other characters reactions to the Dreaded Other characters think this person is pure Nightmare Fuel whether they deserve this reputation or notSee also Mook Horror Show when The Hero is the dreaded to his enemies this is a common way of demonstrating it For instances that mix this trope with Eviler than Thou see Horrifying the Horror Not to be confused with characters who are merely dreaded although both tropes may apply to the same character Comparecontrast Respected by the Respected where a character is defined by the respect other respected characters have for them See Supernatural Fear Inducer for when a character can literally induce dread See Hope Crusher where a character excels at snuffing out hope andor spreading despair Extreme villainous version of this character is a Complete Monster,3579
Hate Sink,The InUniverse reception of Simon Legreenote Played by Horace Horsecollar a friend of Mickey MouseA Hate Sink is a character who is intentionally made by the works creator to be vile and unsympathetic to the audience  While your average Jerkass or Complete Monster can fill the bill an ordinary scumbag works just fine especially in stories where the main antagonist has no face eg in a film about a natural disaster or the Big Bads motives remain sympathetic even when their deeds are evil  This character is written to draw fire and to provide appropriate catharsis for the audience when karma finally catches up to themThe Hate Sink is not The Scrappy the writers wrote the Hate Sink to be hated while the Scrappy garnered a Hatedom on his own But it is possible for a Hate Sink to become a Scrappy if the audience hates him for reasons other than what the creators intended Example Bendy from the Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends episode Everyone Knows Its Bendy was deliberately written to be despised for breaking the rules of the Foster home and framing other imaginary friends in the house for the rulebreaking However because he became a Karma Houdini at the end of the episode he got more hate than was intended As a result the episode actually got so much backlash that its writer Lauren Faust eventually apologized for it and Bendy was not featured in any more episodesSo to summarize The Hate Sink is a character created by the author with the express intention of being loathed by the audience The Scrappy is a character which was not created to be loathed but still isExamples ScrappyDoo and Jar Jar Binks are definitely still hated but they were introduced to their respective franchises without the intention of being loathed by the audience thus rendering them as Scrappies or in the German version of TV Tropes Jar JarsCompare with Complete Monster which is about Audience Reactions to how vile someone can getnote A Hate Sink can be Unintentionally Sympathetic after all AntiRole Model where the character is designed to be a bad example to the audience Love to Hate when the viewers actually enjoy this character because of how effective they are at being hatable The Heavy which is about the impact for the story Jerkass who may be unlikable but stays above the Moral Event Horizon and Jerks Are Worse Than Villains which is when fans hate the jerkass character more than the actual villainnote The Scrappy tends to fall under this trope for all the wrong reasons Contrast with AntiVillain when a villain has sympathetic traits and Laughably Evil when a villain is funny and thus entertaining though in some cases a villain can be both sympathetic and funnyIf all of the works other characters hate this individual instead of the works audience then they are instead Hated by All although the two tropes can and frequently do overlap — a character being Hated By All is often a good indication that the audience is supposed to hate them as well    Subtropes under Hate Sink  Abusive Parents Oh man its still 100 easy its either a parent or both parents that isare abusive with their own child or children and its most likely to start their Start of Darkness Absolute Xenophobe Aliens who kill anything that isnt their own species Asshole Victim A victim of murder or some other violent crime remains unsympathetic if they were a Jerkass beforehand Bad Boss A person in charge who treats their employees like garbage Barbaric Bully An Obviously Evil bully Big Brother Bully An older sibling who treats their younger sibling horribly Bitch in Sheeps Clothing Someone who puts on a façade of kindness to hide away their true vile nature is usually not sympathetic or entertaining The Bully Yep Dirty Coward These villains will try to save their hide instead of coming up with a plan or Last Stand Embodiment of Vice A character who exists to represent a negative trait Entitled Bastard A narcissistic character who sincerely believes they deserve respect from the very people they disrespect andor believes they have the right to do whatever they want and nobody has any right to object Evil Colonialist Cruel exploiters who enslave sell andor outright brutalize the local people False Friend Forming a friendship with another solely to take advantage of their trust The Fundamentalist A person who openly mocks or is hostile towards those whose beliefs dont align with theirs Heel The professional wrestling version bad guy personas who exist to anger the crowd and antagonize the Faces Hope Crusher Villains who are out to drive people to despair are almost never sympathetic especially if they enjoy it Human Traffickers People who enslave and sell other people Its All About Me Unfortunately yes it is and also Dont even think about trying to become selfish only villains and most hated characters can be fit in this trope Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk A character seems to come around to be sympathetic only to turn out to truly be a jerk Killer Cop Someone whos supposed to protect others uses their position to kill them The Klan The Ku Klux Klan and substitutes Lecherous Stepparent A stepparent who makes advances on their stepchildren More Hateable Minor Villain A minor villain written to be loathsome when the Big Bad cannot fill that role More Despicable Minion A minion written to be worse and more detestable than their often sympathetic boss A Nazi by Any Other Name Fantasycounterpart Nazis NotSoWellIntentioned Extremist Someone who claims to be a WellIntentioned Extremist but whose motivations turn out to be selfish Pedophile Priest A priest who sexually abuses children Pervert Dad A father who makes sexual advances on his biological children Politically Incorrect Villain A bigoted villain The Prima Donna An overbearing egocentric and unlikable counterpart to The Diva Rabid Cop A cop who regularly commits Police Brutality Serial Rapist A rapist with multiple

multiple locations without a break Straw Character A character intended to misrepresent views the creator disagrees with Temporary Scrappy A temporary addition to the main cast who is intentionally

New Villain A new villain is introduced who is comparatively less likable than the previous one VillainyFree Villain An antagonist who doesnt do anything truly villainous but has an unpleasant

Happy Birthday to You,Good news guys it isnt copyrighted anymore ♪ Happy birthday to you ♫Isaac Someone holds the copyright to Happy Birthday Dan The representatives of Patty and Mildred Hill Isaac  Took two people to write that song— Sports Night episode 1x04 Intellectual PropertyIts the mostrecognized song in the English language and quite possibly the entire world but before September 22 2015 the lyrics to Happy Birthday to You werent in the public domain in most countriesnote Canada and New Zealand were major exceptions the Happy Birthday copyright expired in Canada in 1985 and NZ in 1997 Its copyright in the United States and Continental Europe was held by WarnerChappell Music a division of Warner Music Group which had acquired it in 1988 from its takeover of the original holder note  Its worth mentioning that the melody itself comes from Good Morning to All a much older song which everyone agrees has been in the public domain for close to a century WMG aggressively enforced the copyright too which netted them around 2 million per year in royalty fees As a result in media prior to 2016 it was rare to hear the actual Happy Birthday songTo avoid fees andor lawsuits productions typically either substituted a public domain folk song — For Hes a Jolly Good Fellow is one example British shows may use A Fine Old English Gentleman instead — or they just made up their own lyrics which may or may not use the actual melody The copyright specifically applied to the combination of the lyrics and the melody speaking or printing out the lyrics was fine and so was using the melody if it had different lyrics or was instrumental This is all in stark contrast to the real world where singing anything other than Happy Birthday To You is almost unheard of except when the singers were the waitstaff of certain chain restaurants for exactly the same reason as mediaThis little ditty — based on another melody sung thousands of times a day around the world and only containing six words — was subject to legal scrutiny for decades The fact that you couldve been sued for realistically portraying an Anglophone birthday party is mindboggling Even foreign language translations were not exempt — Star Trek writers found out that even showing it in Klingon would cost themnote  However given that only the lyrics were under copyright another Klingon phrase set to the same tune would be fair game This case of copyright laws run amok was often subject to Lampshade Hanging which was really all anyone could do as WMG was expected to hold the rights to the lyrics until 2031 at the earliest note  This makes very little sense because the first publication of the lyrics was around 1911 United States copyright law states that almost everything published before 1925 is in the public domain by default Happy Birthday however had a loophole in that a separate copyright claim was filed in 1935 and Patty Hill the last living original rightsholder died in 1946That all changed in The New 10s In 2013 a lawsuit was filed against WarnerChappell Music by Jennifer Nelson whose production company Good Morning to You Productions was filming a documentary about the song and its history To secure the rights to the song and ensure the documentary would be made Nelson had to pay 1500 which she claimed was unreasonable During pretrial hearings in 2015  one day before a scheduled ruling in fact  Nelson and her lawyers discovered evidence that WMGs copyright claim was likely invalid thanks to the discovery of documents mistakenly held from them by WMG including a book published in 1922 titled The Everyday Song Book That book contained the lyrics to Happy Birthday with a disclaimer that they had been used with special permission through courtesy of the Clayton F Summy Conote  thats the company whose IP Warner Music Group ended up with in 1988 but thats not a valid copyright notice which was required at the time of publishing note  Night of the Living Dead 1968 had a similar issue it was distributed to cinemas without a copyright notice thus accidentally and automatically releasing it and by extension pretty much all of the core zombieundead mythos into the public domain That loophole and several others were closed in the 1976 Copyright Act but the law isnt retroactive as that would make it an ex post facto law — ie a law potentially criminalising conduct that was legal before the laws passage such as making copies of andor distributing the Happy Birthday lyrics or prints of Night of the Living Dead — which are specifically prohibited by the United States Constitution Plus when it comes to lawsuits over old intellectual properties American judges look at what the law used to be during the time period in question rather than what it is nowFurthermore only works published in 1923 or later were still potentiallynote if renewed before expiration under copyright at the time Finding it published in 1922 leaves few ways the claimed 1935 copyright could be valid About the only defense would be that the publication was unauthorized — that the Hills had shown the song to the publisher of The Everyday Song Book but didnt reach a deal didnt publish it for thirteen years then copyrighted it in 1935 Even if someone else had coincidentally come up with the same lyrics in 1922 its not that complicated a song but didnt copyright it it wouldnt help Unlike patents independent creation is allowed for copyrighted materials This makes the 1935 copyright valid but useless since everyone can just say theyre performing the 1922 public domain versionAs a result Nelsons lawyers Betsy Manifold and Mark Rifkin claimed WarnerChappell did not own the rights to the lyrics — and on September 22 2015 a US District Court Judge agreed with them ruling WarnerChappells copyright claim officially invalid with a settlement between the parties involved precluding any further appeal However the summary judgement did not by itself put the song into the public domain it only said that WarnerChappells claim is fraudulent and there is no proof that Summy Co ever had a valid claim either It was theoretically possible that someone like an heir to one of the Hill sisters could have stepped forward with a valid claim but no one did so and Happy Birthday officially entered into the public domain in the United States with the court approval of the settlement on June 28 2016In the European Union copyright lasts for the life of the creator plus 70 years This is also true in the United States for noncorporate copyrights US corporate copyrights last for 95 years from publication thanks to a 1998 law derisively called the Mickey Mouse Protection Act As Patty Hill the last surviving author died in 1946 Happy Birthday was already set to fall into the public domain on December 31 2016 American court rulings have no effect across The Pond so Europe had to wait several more weeksTime will tell what effect this has on public performances of the song though at least one thing is finally certain — producers filmmakers average citizens posting birthday parties on YouTube and people washing their hands while singing to this song twice as a

Justified Trope,A justified trope is one which in its common usage runs counter to the normal laws of logic and probability but in a particular instance has a concrete reason InUniverse for applying to the story In other words a trope is justified if it is required by other preexisting elements in the story—otherwise the explanation is a Hand WaveNote that there are varying degrees of justifying a trope and a spectrum of justification from the completely logical to A Wizard Did It For a justification to be more than just A Wizard Did It there has to be reasons that make it make sense in contextHeres a couple example scenarios A protagonist uses a glowing sword A characters car explodes upon crashingThe justified case The protagonist uses a glowy sword because he fights sentient shadows The car blew up upon crashing because of the nitroglycerin that was put in the trunk earlier as part of a ploy to blast through a bank vaultNow how would these same scenarios look if the justifications were Hand Waves that raise more questions and require you to turn your brain off The protagonist uses a glowy sword because the power source is leaky But wait shouldnt that cause other problems We also know that he has the tools to fix it The car blew up upon being shot because the shooter aimed for the gas tank and said he used tracer rounds But wait why would he have tracer rounds in his service pistolA justified trope has common ground with Lampshading in that both often deal with tropes that are typically illogical or otherwise problematicRemember that a trope being justified is not about it ultimately being good or bad or effective or ineffective — its about whether or not it makes sense from an inuniverse point of view A trope can be perfectly justified and still ruin a show Contrarily a trope may be completely unjustified and make the story better Do not assume that the existence of a trope is inherently a sign of bad writingSee The Watson whose job is to explain justifications and Meta Trope Intro which compares this with many other ways that a trope can be used If the Justified Trope falls short its a Hand Wave If the justification just makes the illogic of the trope worse then it becomes a Voodoo SharkOne thing to note if you think a trope is justified you should never use a Justifying Edit If you were Pot Holed here by a Justifying Edit integrate the potholed text to the main text or delete it outright See Justifying Edit for more on thisSome justified tropes are tropes of their own It Only Works Once is when Never Recycle Your Schemes is justified Portal to the Past is a justification of San Dimas TimeDont put any examples here Wicks on other pages must be inuniverse and also Not Arguable That is when writing one resist the temptation to use Weasel Words like possibly probably somewhat or partially If you want to see examples youll have to look for them elsewhere Or you could go into the Playing With Wiki for hypothetical examplesNotably instead of redirecting here the singleword Justified is a disambiguation page If youre looking for the FX series youre looking for JustifiedImportant LinksAdvertisementTVTropes is licensed under a Creative Commons AttributionNonCommercialShareAlike 30 Unported License Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available from  thestafftvtropesorg,3323

Children Are Innocent,Image by Laurie Snow HeinAmen I say to you unless you turn and become like children you will not enter the kingdom of heaven Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven— Matthew 1834 The Bible NABREVictorianera Anglosphere invented modern childhood Inspired by the ideals of The Enlightenment and an interpretation of The Bibles New Testament based on them they came to the conclusion that the time people spent between being a baby and being useful to society was special and precious  that people this age were innocent and full of wonder and beloved by God and that they should be loved and protected and cared for by society in general They came to believe that there was a stark contrast between the innocent and instinctual goodness of children and the cynical evil of adults After several decades the grassroots belief in and support for childhood became so strong that children under certain ages were actually forbidden from doing certain types of work despite the dedicated lobbying of business interests who didnt want to lose their smallest and cheapest workers eg smaller coalminers mean smaller mineshafts By 1900 only a fifth or so of British and US children under 16 were in fulltime employment with the UK restricting child labor in 1933 and the USA doing the same in 1938The age European culture has assigned to the end of childhood has grown over the years and an in between period was added in The 50s or so  teenagehood  but the meme remains a child is a Blank Slate not yet sullied by the evils of the world Only upon coming of age do they lose this innocence and the protection it confers A childs death is a true tragedy an adults death is sad but just as it isThe Children Are Innocent trope captures the idea that children are never naturally evil A consequence is that harming one is the ultimate evil act no matter how provoked  unless that is forcing others to harm them This is an extremely pervasive trope that is at the heart of many other tropes such as Friend to All Children and Harmful to Minors as well as frequently the root of both Papa Wolf and Mama Bear When the Big Bad kills nameless hundreds the heroes will say the villain killed women and children The Children Are Innocent trope is old enough that it is difficult to assign it an age but at the minimum it goes back to the New TestamentExpect those who buy into this trope to hold that any villain character Used to Be a Sweet Kid until something bad happened to them especially if they also believe that Rousseau Was Right Sometimes that something bad is as simple as puberty and thus worldly experience which again ties into the New Testament stuffOffstage children almost always fall under this trope like some legal systems children are innocent until proven guilty Being informed that a character has killed injured exploited etc children is always a mark of evil without such proof Indeed one of the commonest ways to disprove Always Chaotic Evil is to bring up their children as in the Genocide Dilemma For instance nothing makes a heroic human adventurer look more villainous than an Empathy Doll Shot in a decimated goblin villageWhere blond hair is found naturally children are often depicted with it This trope is considered to drive Hair of Gold Heart of Gold because children and the young are more likely to have blond hair than older people thus blond hair is a sign of innocenceThis is the standard for an Innocent Prodigy and often comes into play for A Child Shall Lead Them Innocence is also generally behind Constantly Curious Curious as a Monkey and Cheerful ChildFrequently children Cannot Tell a Lie because they are too innocent to think of suppressing the truth Children who do start to lie often show this is new to them by being monumentally Bad Liars On the other hand this very quality can lead to their being Too Dumb to FoolPart and parcel of this is depicting children as the other meaning of innocent naive gullible and too trusting They can misunderstand anything other than the most obvious This can lead to an unawareness that they are doing anything wrong They can commit offenses unwittingly and face a Bewildering Punishment Children have to learn empathy and not to be selfcentered and also often have a poor grasp of consequences of their actions This can then lead to Ambiguous InnocenceIn contrast the Creepy Child the Enfante Terrible and Corruption by a Minor draw much of their force from their knowingness They understand as much if not more than the adults about them which contradicts not only this trope but the general understanding of children A Serial Killer can give anyone the chills but the effect is magnified if the killer is a childThe Spoiled Brat the Mouthy Kid the Bratty HalfPint and Kids Are Cruel can be complex examples They may have been born that way have been this trope and then something happened to them to remove that aspect or they could have a Hidden Heart of Gold which restores the aspect In the first case if the causes of the spoiling are clearly identified and the children revert to innocence when they are removed the children may still be innocentTeenage Wasteland is a similar case since children now have adult power and responsibility despite still being children the forced loss of innocence may be a major theme Ironically it is reinforced by a Childless Dystopia what with how miserable things generally become without themSubtrope for Children Are Special In this case it is their innocence that makes them specialAmnesiacs are Innocent is based on a similar idea The Amnesiacs has returned to the Blank Slate status of a child because theyve lost all the worldly experience that made them lose itInvoked however derisively by Silly Rabbit Idealism Is for Kids A more worldly yet still innocent child may reply that Silly Rabbit Cynicism Is for Losers,5879

Prisoner Exchange,You send over our guys and well send over the two Big Macs and large CokeOne of the heroes has been captured by the bad guys His friends know where hes being kept but the dungeon lies deep within the villains impenetrable fortress surrounded by guards and a good oldfashioned prison break simply wont doHowever it just so happens that one of the opposition has been spotted wandering around outside Camp Good Guy and was conveniently dumb enough to get caught Now there are two captives one in each campSo what do the two opposing sides do in this situation Each has something the other wants and neither is willing to let up unless they can find a way to use the situation to their advantage So they agree to trade hostages They meet up at a certain location where the exchange will take place both prisoners get to go free and everyones happy RightUsually the captured member of the other team is no ordinary Mook He may be someone who is important to the villain in some way someone he cares about or needs in order to fulfill his Evil Plan otherwise the other side would not bother with trying to get him back Heroes usually dont need this kind of motivation to rescue a captive comrade as they generally need less of a reason to save people A Messianic Archetype may risk both his life and the chance of giving up whatever advantage he may have had coupled with letting a villain go free in order to save a total stranger although its just as likely that the captive will be someone close to the hero in order to facilitate dramaThe exchange often involve both parties facing each other across a wide open area with armed soldiers present or hidden in case the other party tries something Each captive walks toward the other they pass by each other in the center and proceed on to their own group Often takes place on a bridge since it marks the only crossing point of a natural barrier such as a river or chasm where two territories would typically be divided It also gives both sides a clear view of each other as well as of the hostages in case anyone tries anything funny providing there is no Ominous Fog and can be symbolic for the hostages making their journey homeNote that the downside of this agreement is because Evil Is Petty villains rarely make fair trades While a hero will be bound to keep his word and make sure that the hostage is returned to the villain unharmed the villain will often take the first opportunity to kill his hostage as soon as he gets what he wants or to cause the heroes to walk into a trap or find some other way to go back on his promiseCunning good guys or AntiHeroes may realize this and never intend to make a trade with the villain in the first place or both sides may have the intention of screwing each other over in which case the hostages themselves rarely have any say in the matter and may end up on the worse end of the dealIf the hero decides to trade themself for the hostage its Take Me Instead See also Hostage Situation and Checkpoint Charlie,3002

Groin Attack,Woman of Steel Crotch of KleenexBut the ball In his groin It works on so many levels— Homer Simpson critique of amateur film Man Getting Hit By Football The SimpsonsIts not always played for comedy but seeing someone get struck in the crotch is usually just plain funny Whether the object doing the striking is an errant piece of sports equipment or a deliberately placed foot the end result is going to be a grown man doubled over and trembling with pain Bonus points if he then hobbles away and says something in a highpitched voice Not only will everyone find this hilarious but tape it and play it back for the guy and even he will probably laugh At least once the swelling goes down Sometimes a cause of Amusing Injuries especially if the victim is asking for it In shows targeted at children its often a Dangerous Forbidden Technique or at least treated as one instory see 3 Ninjas and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie In Japanese media the blow is often accompanied by the sound of a bellEffectively this is a humananatomys version of Attack Its Weak Point for massive damage A subversion of this is Balls of Steel where a character — for whatever reason — does not take damage from a Groin Attack or at least doesnt take extra damageThis trope is made possible thanks to an interesting quirk in the human bodys design as the testicles function best at a temperature slightly lower than the core body temperature this is why they hang slightly lower and can be raised or lowered by reflex activity to ensure they stay at the right temperature in relation to ambient conditions Thus compared to other body parts even the other ones typically seen as weak points stomach solar plexus toes etc ones Crown Jewels are considerably less armoured hence why striking them hurts so muchThis usually only applies to men Female characters are rarely subjected to groin attacks of any kind and when they are they are also likely to just shrug off in a momentnote While the female genitals are better protected than their male counterparts the female groin area itself is full of nerve endings and sensitive skin tissue that when hit while not as painful as it would be on a man will still be quite debilitating Female genitals also lack the squish factor that comes from swinging in the wind On the symbolic level a groin attack on a male— especially if its delivered by a female — represents that male being brought low by a wellplaced blow to the very source of his masculine prideIn contrast to most groin attacks groin attacks that draw blood or involve some form of mutilation are very likely not to be played for comedy — and owing to the Primal Fear of bad things happening to our nether regions particularly nasty attacks of this nature can be downright disturbing Apart from being a hallmark of the Lust variant of the Serial Killer this form of attack is most often used as either a particularly vicious form of ColdBlooded Torture or as a way for Antiheroes to punish rapists and other sexual criminals though a particularly vicious Combat Pragmatist may also use this tactic as just one more way to even the score or gain the upper hand in a fight It may still come off as funny though if the guy is perceived as having brought it upon himself such as having his gun go off in his pants See Crippling Castration for examples of groin attacks that lead to the unfortunate victim losing his organsthe ability to procreateAlong with Taser Tag Weakness the Groin Attack also seems to be very effective against Superheroes and Supervillains although some of them are immuneCompare Freudian Threat Very common from someone in Pervert Revenge Mode For certain kinds of groin injuries actual or threatened specifically related to sexual encounters see both Vagina Dentata and Man of Steel Woman of Kleenex Also see Standard Female Grab Area for a similar incapacitating spot Eye Scream Fingore and The Tooth Hurts are other primal fear reactions The Distaff Counterpart to this trope is Breast Attack although women can be subject to Groin Attacks as well despite what the Female Groin Invincibility trope would have you think Often utilized by a Combat Pragmatist and commonly followed up by Instant Soprano andor Share the Male Pain Not an uncommon aftereffect of Tar and Feathers May be used as part of a Balls Gag though the overlap is smaller than one might think NearMiss Groin Attack is when an aversion of this trope is Played for LaughsIt might involve a Sympathetic Wince and possibly a Universal Group Reaction,4526
Vapor Wear,No support needed for PeneloWhen a characters costume doesnt include underclothes their bra panties or both seem to be AWOL Theyre usually female but the trope isnt gender exclusiveThe outer clothing may be made from a translucent material with strategically placed lace or tape for modesty feature a NavelDeep Neckline or a Cleavage Window be cut to show off Sideboob or Underboobs or may be something backless but whatever the case its obvious that the outside costume is all that the person is wearing If any underclothes are worn at all they must be made of air  or should we say Vapor WearOf course this is often Truth in Television perhaps as a way of being daring or flaunting convention Today its common among celebrities and in runway fashion During the 1970s the look was even a part of mainstream street fashion the more obvious a womans lack of a bra was the betterVapor Wear is the default dress code for The Vamp and the Femme Fatale whose personality traits match up well with the need to not waste any time removing their knickers and who if seen in something less vampy will specifically mention the lack of underwear which can thereby present even an ordinary outfit as something interesting or unusual As such it is frequently a significant factor in the Theiss Titillation Theory A similar trope applies to Hot as Hell demons and Succubi and Incubi with the exception of one popular succubus who tend to avert or even invert this tropeThis trope can also apply to male characters but rarely does because nipple nubs tend to be more socially acceptable than a certain bulge If something should be there but isnt its probably thanks to Barbie Doll Anatomy common in most forms of animation as well as a sign you might be overthinking thingsThe trope is common in Science Fiction and Fantasy regardless of the medium perhaps because its easier to insert fetishes in an invented world than in the real world It is also common in Historical Fiction but more often than not this is not historically correct — most people did wear underwear even in ancient times though it may not have looked like what is worn todayThis is occasionally known as itenai a shortened form of 履いてない haitenai which means not wearing over legships in Japan especially when the question is she or isnt she wearing them is left deliberately ambiguousSince the 1990s the trope is quite commonly inverted with people wearing skimpy or seethrough clothing to show off the undergarments beneath Interestingly enough the effect is more or less the same as playing the trope straight titillation by showing what is not supposed to be seenNot to be confused with Censor Steam Vaporware or Vaporwave nor with the similarly named Real Life clothing company that alas bears absolutely no relation to this trope For a more generalized version see Going Commando which means just not wearing underwear without necessarily being obvious about it,2922
Revised Ending,When it comes time for an author to wrap everything up the final judgment on his ultimate creation hinges on the conclusion an ending can make or break an entire work or series So important is the ending in fact that its especially subject to Executive Meddling and public influenceThe biggest problem arises when the author has already written andor produced the final ending and executives or test audiences dislike it most commonly due to it being a Downer Ending They pressure the author to change the ending to one they think the public will like better usually to a Happily Ever After The author reluctantly complies and the ending is changed see also Happily Ever Before — a specific type of subtropeIf the endings were radically different what usually happens is that the original ending is revealed to the public in a later edition and fans become split between favoring the original or revised ending For some reason Downer Endings are usually considered to be the better of the two partly because they are more likely to be the original and people get hung up on the directors original vision — and of course True Art Is Angsty But as was previously mentioned it can be the exact opposite as wellCan be seen as a form of Authors Saving Throw if the Revised Ending was created to appease audiencesBe warned considering this trope is specifically about the endings to works it should be painfully obvious that spoilers are going to occurFocus Group Ending is a subtrope When the revised ending changes an ending that was already shown its also an Orwellian Retcon If an ending is only changed when it is adapted to another medium see Adaptational Alternate EndingSince this is an Ending Trope expect spoilers,1717
Foil,Don Quixote  Sancho PanzaIll be your foil Laertes In mine ignorance Your skill shall like a star i th darkest night Stick fiery off indeed— Hamlet Hamlet Act V scene iiJewelers often put shiny metal foil underneath a gem to make the stone shine brighter or display them on dark velvet to bring attention to their brightness A literary foil serves a similar purpose it is to provide contrast to another character by accentuating their differencesSidekicks often serve as the heros foil a calm and pragmatic sidekick will accompany a hotheaded hero for example or a conventionallybrave hero will drag a Lovable Coward In the classic story of Good vs Evil the hero and villain play the others foil in that each acts to show how the other behaves in certain situations But virtually any story with multiple characters can use contrast to show greater depths to them two persons do not have to be on opposite ends of the moral spectrum to be foilsFoils need to be seen together the interaction between the contrasting characters is what makes this trope work A pair of foils may be strangers when the story begins but they need to come together at some point in the story and let their opposed personalities shine through Otherwise we just have a pair of characters with different personalitiesIf youve got a series where a hero from a later installment is the opposite of a hero from earlier on theyve got to interact with each other somewhere in the series for them to count as foils Otherwise youve got a Contrasting Sequel Main Character The same goes for the baddies unless the contrasting villain from the earlier installment interacts with the villain from the later installment youre looking at a Contrasting Sequel AntagonistMany foils are depicted as physical contrasts to the main character though a contrasting appearance alone isnt sufficient for a character to be a foil Thin vs fat and tall vs short are among the most common ways of setting up a contrast Opposing genders and races are common even in modern media but often tend to be handled more delicately due to these types of differences being an Unfortunate Implications minefieldIf youre feeling a little poetic and look around at your surroundings enough youll probably discover that this trope is a bit of Truth in TelevisionFor this tropes own foil see Mirror Character which is about characters who highlight each others similaritiesSee also Duo Tropes,2424

Dirty Coward,It is better to be the right hand of the Devil than in his path— Beni Gabor The Mummy 1999The Dirty Coward is the slime of the earth working exclusively for themselves and shamelessly retreating from harms way even if that harm is about to hit the AllLoving Hero that just saved their life two seconds ago Theyll take every advantage are not above using dishonorable tactics and dirty tricks and theyll be more than happy to push someone including their friend at the danger just to save their own skin but theyll cry and moan every time the tables are turned and someone uses the same tactics against them asks for a volunteer or reminds them of that promise they made Often full of vicious plans for anyone they dislike as long as they arent in need of that persons skills at the momentThough the Dirty Coward may be a sociopath or a Social Darwinist theyre certainly not heroic or comedic And if theyre a bastard theyre certainly not meant to be magnificent Theyre usually only marginally competent to start with and even the cleverest of them tends to be shortsighted Even when they know that breaking ranks will leave a hole in the defenses that will let the enemy in leading to far more danger for them in the long term they will generally run for it anyway and get shot In the Back Their allegiance almost always lies with whoever can cause them the most immediate harm even if that threat isnt likely to last Theyll be happy to badmouth people to their faces when they can not immediately hurt them only to attempt to curry favor when the roles reverse Dirty Cowards are especially prone to suffering a Karmic Death usually at the hands of whatever they were trying to run from and are similarly likely to suffer a Villainous Breakdown Dirty Cowards often flipflop from smugness to groveling depending on whether they have the advantage at the moment An arrogant villain might beg for his life when the heroes have him at their mercy only to take advantage of the heroes lowered guard to escape or strike back then mock them for their carelessnessOther times it can be subtle  Confronting fear isnt always punching the right person in the face—sometimes the cowardice can come from running from ones responsibilities  A Disappeared Dad or Missing Mom that went to get milk one day as opposed to having a seriously good reason can be an example  Other forms of estrangement can be the result of cowardice on either partys side whos right depends on the authorUsually a villain unless used comically although they may sometimes be a certain type of civilian that gets in the way When used as a villain this is a cheap way to make the heroes look good in comparison even if theyre not everything they should be Villainous Dirty Cowards tend to fall squarely into Neutral Evil since they are first and foremost out for their own hides at the expense of others One of the best ways to demean the Big Bad is by making them out to be a coward Its doubly ironic if the one who brings fear into the hearts of others turns out to be a pathetic joke who hypocritically makes others feel weak because they are really the weak one and try to hide it After all only The Bully can bring the dirty into the Dirty Coward tropeIts tough to make a main character into one of these without them coming off as more slimy and irritating than funny Unlike most villains the dirty coward doesnt even have finesse which can make them extremely annoying The dirty coward may or may not have a horrific past to explain their actions but it doesnt usually redeem them at least not in the minds of the audience When their backstory doesnt seem all that convincing but convinces The Hero it can be seen as a major copoutThe best way to make this character tolerable is to make them at least somewhat clever Some enlightened selfinterest can occasionally be mixed in although too much of any trait other than cravenness tends to change the character into something elseMay be on the receiving end of a Cowardice Callout May Level Grind in courage if they realize My God What Have I DoneThe Dirty Coward is pretty much almost Always Male for the dubious reason that women arent expected to be brave in the first place and are allowed to sacrifice others to save themselves Fridge Logic may lead to the Neutral Female coming off as a Distaff Counterpart to the Dirty CowardMay be the Miles Gloriosus and even believe his own brags when out of danger The Fearless Fool may invoke this to persuade his companions to act like idiots A FairWeather Foe could be considered a social form of this acting mean to their enemies if they can afford to but are willing to act nice if acting mean could have consequences Cases of Would Hurt a Child and Bad People Abuse Animals often have undertones of this since they involve harming something innocent and unable to defend themself Not to be confused with the Combat Pragmatist who may employ tactics that can be considered dirty and cowardly but does so out of cold calculation rather than fear Contrast the Lovable Coward who numbers among the good guys and has foibles portrayed far more sympathetically generally due to their not trying to pose as anything but a coward Even then they will often face their fears and ultimately still risk their lives if the chips are really down as will the Cowardly Lion The SoCalled Coward is by definition mistaken for one of these if they dont want to be theyll say Nobody Calls Me Chicken See also The Bully characters who are brave enough when tormenting those weaker than they are but showing their true colors in the face of those equal to or stronger than they are Original Position Fallacy where one holds a moral position on the assumption that they will receive the benefits without considering that they may be among the ones to suffer from said beliefs Sore Loser where someone isnt afraid of death or injury so much as they are of losing though many Dirty Cowards are also Sore Losers and Opportunistic Bastard Does not apply when retreating really is the most practical option one has Often overlaps with Screw This Im Outta Here where someone enters a situation that they dont want to be

Barbaric Bully,To see the nerds driven before me and to hear the lamentations of their math clubHes big hes dumb hes got the IQ of gum Hes got the brain about the size of a sourdough crumb But hell beat on your head like a big bass drum His behavior is truly unruly Hes a bully— Phineas and Ferb Hes a BullyIn fictional works involving young characters school bullying is commonly used to create conflict andor build sympathy for a Woobie protagonist but it is often limited to physical bullying with comparatively few works acknowledging or depicting psychological and social bullying The ideal Hollywood Bully is invariably a physically imposing thuggish Obviously Evil bigot who terrorizes victims through overt obvious physical force that can easily be recognized by anyoneThis kind of bullying easily lends itself to the visual media since a loud fleeting schoolyard scuffle is much more interesting to watch on the big screen than hours of more subtle psychological torment A climactic fistfight with a bully also provides a much simpler and easier way for writers to resolve a conflict whereas psychologicalsocial bullying doesnt give viewers a loud spectacle it is harder for adults to recognize and resolve and harder for victims to prove and it requires far more attention to Character Development to make it convincing since a bully has to be believably popular to have the circle of friends needed to pull it off At the end of the day delving into the consequences of scrapes and bruises is a far easier job for writers than delving into the consequences of depression selfloathing and social isolationInterestingly this represents something of a gender Double Standard as well since thuggish bullies in fiction will almost exclusively be male with the most common of such being the Jerk Jock whereas the few times that psychological bullying is shown it will exclusively be the domain of petty giggling Alpha Bitches who torment less popular girls with verbal barbs With female bullies physical fights will be shown to be the incredibly rare exception to the rule while the opposite is true of male bullies Much like with brutish male bullies though dealing with a bullying Alpha Bitch will invariably be as simple as dispatching her with a cathartic series of pranks or a simple verbal smackdownMost of the time the teachers never really do anything to stop the bullying either because theyre oblivious the bully is very good at playing the Wounded Gazelle Gambit to get off scotfree and paint their victim as the bully or they get a kick out of seeing the victim suffer possibly even using the bully as their attack dogOn the flipside though these kinds of bullies tend to be all brawn and no brain sometimes bordering on Too Dumb to Live In this case their victim tends to find a way to outsmart them maybe even humiliate them in the processSubTrope of The Bully Compare Women Are Delicate the reason for the abovementioned distinction between male and female bullying Obviously Evil and CardCarrying Villain,3009
Retcon,Theyre talking about a Space Elevator And smashing the fourth wall to smithereens while theyre at itComic book fans will be familiar with the term retcon which in laymans terms means that the writer waves his hand and tells you Remember when we said this We screwed up forget about that— Spoony on Highlander III The SorcererRetroactive ContinuityReframing or adding to past events to serve a current plot need Take the page image a preexisting space elevator is in the city but one did not appear to exist earlier in the work despite the fact that a building reaching up into space would be plain to see in any wide shot However the current story requires a space elevator so its been added and treated as if its always been thereIn its most basic form a retcon is any plot point or detail that was not intended from the beginning but treated as if it always had been contrast this with The Reveal where the author usually intended such an addition from the beginning The most preferred use is where it contradicts nothing even though it was changed later on An ideal retcon clarifies a question alluded to without adding excessive new questionsWhile the term comes from comic books dating to AllStar Squadron 18 in 1983 and shortened to retcon by the end of the decade the technique is much older Often its used to serve a new plot by changing its context or expanding an existing setting however its also done when the creators are caught writing a story that violates continuity and isnt very plausibleIn Marvel Comics the person who pointed out the problem and at the same time provided a plausible explanation was awarded a Genuine Marvel Comics NoPrize by editor Stan Lee a tradition that was kept alive by other editors after he became publisherSee also Ass Pull which is something that was not properly set up before it is sprung on the audience and Cliffhanger Copout in which a perilous situation is retroactively changed to allow the characters to escape It is related to Deus ex Machina Some but not all retcons are Ass Pulls and a good retcon can actually improve the current narrative A good way to get away with a retcon is to reveal new implications or motivations for events that have already been establishedSmoother retcons wont be distinguishable as such and can even make what was initially an Ass Pull later look like everything was Just as Planned In other words No Prize it into plausibility and away from the dizzying realm of the Ass PullThe retcon is considered by many to occur when current events contradict the past continuity of the series and is evidence of a Writer on Board Perhaps more often the retcon does not actually violate Canon but rather violates fanon the set of unstated interpretations usually made by the audience an interpretation violated this way is said to be Jossed Most competent writers achieve a retcon by relying on a lessobvious but still perfectly valid interpretation of what was previously seenAs the number of twists and misdirections in a story becomes higher it becomes more difficult to tell whether an event actually is a retcon which implies that the writers changed their minds or a misdirection which implies that the writers intended the retconned version all along and had been deliberately misleading the audience before In some cases it is impossible to tell short of reading the authors mind even then it might not helped as its entirely possible for an author to be on the fence about what theyre planning to doA retcon may be used as part of an Armed with Canon campaign launched by one author against the work of another author in the same Shared Universe Overuse of retcons can result in Continuity Snarl It can also result in your readers and fans approaching the work with a certain degree of skepticism cynicism or even complete uninterest especially if you tend to obviously and quickly retcon away that which turns out to be unpopular or drastically challenges or changes the status quo — after all why get involved in your latest Crisis Crossover Event which promises to change everything forever and that nothing will be the same again if theres a good chance itll all just be retconned away after a short period of timeSometimes retcons involve little more than altering the timeline of events to occur later than originally stated This is common in science fiction franchises that are set in the not too distant future Once that future date becomes the past in reality this necesitates the redating of the work in order to keep it set in the future This happens with a lot of long running scifi series that were conceived for example in The 60s and set in The 90s or early years of the twenty first centurySome retcons occur for no purpose other than to address a goof in the scriptwriting that aired before it was spotted This often occurs in series where you will constantly have Loads and Loads of Writers and often just as many different editors and script checkers It wasnt too crucial in the days before home video when it was likely that viewers would never see an episode again Thus they were just as likely to forget that two character who back in season one say that theyve known each other since law school now claim in season three that they literally grew up together on the same street In trying to reconcile these two claims it often leads to a lot of other unanswered questions that now need to be addressed without contradicting or contriving too muchThis happens very easily with prequels when the writers arent being very careful On the other hand Tropes Are Not Bad Its entirely possible that an author will retcon their own work to fix a Continuity Snarl or even apply an Authors Saving Throw if things get really hairy Sometimes if the preretconned works are no longer considered canon by the author those works are discontinued in canon In LongRunners retcons are often used to fix Values Dissonance to address problems stemming from the various manifestations of Time Marches On or to bring previous parts of the story in line with shifts resulting from things like Doing In the Wizard Sometimes People actually like the Retcon better  and thus they dont take much of an issue with itCompare FlipFlop of God Tends to come in The Reveal format May involve Opening a Can of Clones Can at times also qualify as a Throw It In Sometimes a result of Depending on the Writer or Depending on the ArtistSpecific variants Backported Development When someones characterization in flashbacks is tweaked to more closely resemble their current self a retcon to address Characterization Marches On Canon Discontinuity Previous events are treated as if they never happened Cerebus Retcon Sometimes a result of Cerebus Syndrome that makes a past event more serious as part of a shift to drama Chuck Cunningham Syndrome A character disappeared from the narrative without explanation Continuity Snarl In shared universes that undergo changes in management new generations of creative teams contemporary writers are less inclined to slavishly adhere to internal consistency with plots events or visual styles that were written twenty thirty forty or more years ago especially when those older stories are now outdated as they were originally presented Heinousness Retcon A returning villains crimes or personality are retconned to make them betterworse than originally established Retgone A character InUniverse is told to not exist Revision A continuity alteration that doesnt directly contradict any previous material Rewrite A retcon that openly overwrites the facts of the previous continuity Orwellian Retcon The prior events that contradict the new continuity get rewritten Cosmic Retcon An instory event alters reality which causes a retcon Retconjuration An instory ability to alter reality which causes a retcon Remember the New Guy A new character is introduced but is retconned to have been part of the story all alongRelated concepts for explaining away retcons can include the Hand Wave or Lampshading can also involve an Unreliable Narrator See also an Internal Retcon for retcons within a fictional universe or External Retcon for retcons in real life,8157

Darker and Edgier,ITS SMURFING AWESOME Image by RyanKinnaird Used with permissionYou look around these days its all different Its all changed The Jokers killing people for Gods sake Did I miss something Was I away when they changed the rules— The Riddler Secret Origins When Is a DoorA Tone Shift that seeks to make a work of fiction more serious cynical or grittyIn theory this means that archetypes which we are accustomed to see acting in a more noble setting will have to act in one where they must think and act grimly in order to make progress thus forcing reexamination of the tropes involved or the use of new tropes and expansion of the setting utilizing different sorts of characters and stories In practice however writers can be too lazy to realize all that potential and end up randomly spicing up a work with gratuitous gore cursing and sex to make it more adult — often overdoing it in the process This is not to be confused with Tough LoveWhen done right Darker and Edgier works are a case of Tropes Are Tools When a show uses this trope as a tagline you can expect a mixture of awful things happening to the characters twisted backstories giving them a reason to angst good and bad becoming less obvious and the setting becoming much bleaker However this all works IF its done rightAs one could predict this is fairly easy to screw up and poor use of these tropes may just result in Too Bleak Stopped Caring if the setting gets too hopeless or Narm if the edginess becomes just silly This doesnt make it a bad trope though— when used subtly such as in the Harry Potter series it can create the effect of a series growing up with its audienceIn fact this is often the purpose of a Darker and Edgier turn Just as a Lighter and Softer tone is typically part of an attempt to bring a fictional world to children or to younger children a darker tone is often intended to make a setting appeal to older children or adults But unlike its opposite a Darker and Edgier shift is often intended not to reach a new audience but rather to keep an existing audience as it grows up It can also be a result of child fans growing up as its creators and continuing to think of the setting as something aimed at themselves and their peers instead of the original target age groupThis trope became extremely popular in Comic Books as a rebellion against the Silver Age but also led to more than a decade of a lot of clumsy attempts by many writers to show that comics are not kid stuff anymore See the Bronze Age the Dark Age and 90s AntiHero for more details about how this workedThe excessive version is often known as Grimdark one word derived from the tagline of Warhammer 40000 In the grim darkness of the far future there is only war Sometimes justified with the phrase Silly Rabbit Idealism Is for Kids Usually shows up in Dark Fic If a preexisting show undergoes a Retool under the guise of making things Darker And Edgier expect Jumping the Shark especially if there was Executive Meddling involved The United Federation of Charles wrote an essay called What is Grimdark which explains some of the history of the subject Overly Sarcastic Productions has a video on this subject as well Grimderp has in many parts of the Net become popular as a term for Grimdark that goes so far that it becomes Narm When a specific character rather than the work as a whole is perceived as having become excessively Darker And Edgier a popular term is Edgelord Which also gets applied to fanfic writers who produce exclusively Grimdark or especially Grimderp worksAs with Lighter and Softer this practice tends to go better if the change was planned in advance to keep the tone from shifting too abruptlyThis is a common result of an ongoing work suddenly becoming subject to less censorship than it had been previously as was the case with the Comics Code fading away When the writers had previously been scarcely allowed to depict any violence swearing or innuendo at all but are then finally given permission you can fully expect them to go wildly overboard with it for a while This will of course attract some audience members and repel others but eventually both the viewers and the writers will likely want to scale things back to some level between the original squeakyclean version and the later Rrated version note If the standard metaphor is a franchise trying to grow up one may compare this to a young adult getting a first taste of freedom and then gradually learning selfrestraintNote that this is not the same as a Deconstruction A Deconstruction plays out the genres conventions to their logical conclusions in order to criticize the initial genre conventions This does not have to be dark see for instance Deconstructive Parody and it does not prevent things from turning out well Darker And Edgier just adds dark elements to try and get the same effect Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt but often a Deconstruction can cause a work to seem darker because its calling attention to dark aspects already implied but previously glossed over see also Ascended Fridge HorrorOpposite of Lighter and Softer Younger and Hipper Denser and Wackier and Revisiting the Roots Often found alongside Bloodier and Gorier Hotter and Sexier Ruder and Cruder Sequel Logo in Ruins and Real Is Brown Often a byproduct of the franchise growing bigger and more

Wise Beyond Their Years,Pictured wiseI grow sick and tired of all the same old lies I might be a little young so whats wrong You dont have to be old to be wise— Judas Priest You Dont Have to Be Old to Be WiseChildren who are more mature than their age implies with a solid comprehension of abstract concepts good foresight and an understanding of human nature beyond what most kids their age haveThere are many ways to show that children are wise beyond their years Kids who found themselves the head of a family and take their responsibilities seriously the Kid Hero who actually treats their duty in a way an older hero does and doesnt simply see it it as an adventure the teenager who refuses a stupid prank under all pressure the cunning Enfant Terrible capable of planning and backstabbing that would make an Evil Overlord proudThere may be a reason why these kids are what they are Parental Abandonment or even worse a Teenage Wasteland could force a kid to mature very fast and a traumatic enough life could burn the childhood out of the most extreme and tragic examples of this trope However some of these characters are simply like this by natureThis trope applies to a good portion of anime characters probably to appeal to a young audience while still being able to let the characters exhibit more mature behavior like engaging in fierce combat or taking up leadership roles This consequently makes such characters more relatable to a mature audience as well as long as its done well and the matter of young age doesnt raise too many eyebrowsNote that this is based on the mentality of the character Just being shoved into an adult role wont cut it the average Kid Hero and Bratty HalfPint tend to be highly immature after all Intelligence tends to be different from maturity as well some Kid Geniuses can invent hyperdrives in their backyard but act in a very childish manner everywhere else A good number of kids under Improbable Age count but if the kid is in a highranking position and still thinks like a kid they wont fit hereFrequently speaks in Little Professor Dialog and may enjoy Entertainment Above Their AgeContrast One of the Kids Manchild and Kiddie Kid Compare Adorably Precocious Child who tries to be like this but is still a kid at heart Compare Child Prodigy who is basically a TV Genius in child form Innocent Prodigy is when a child really is like this but still retains a childlike innocence in other aspects of life If the character has an outgoing personality they might be a Mouthy Kid or Little Miss Snarker and when this characters maturity is displayed in a villainous light they may become a Creepy Child When every kid in a franchise acts like this or at least most of them its probably because Most Writers Are Adults Kids may be forced into this by living in a Teenage Wasteland If the adultlike behavior is disturbing rather than impressive its Troubling Unchildlike Behavior If a Child Prodigy acts like an adult in a childs world rather than being thrust into the adult one theyre Acting Your Intellectual Age,3032
Oh Crap,And Simba gets an even bigger one because of what happens nextIts that moment of dawning comprehension I live for— Hobbes Calvin and HobbesThe moment at which a character realizes that something really REALLY bad is about to happen Either that or it already has and they are in big trouble because of it They may not always say anything in particular when they do but even if they do not the look on their face clearly conveys to the audience their realization This moment often features stronger language and is when they truly realize that things are about to royally hit the fan Sometimes the first few notes of Fryderyk Chopins Funeral March are used as background music to highlight how grim the situation isThere are lots of ways to react to moments like this Characters may often exclaim stuff along the lines of You Have GOT to Be Kidding Me I Want My Mommy or sometimes even This Cannot Be Other characters might emit a Loud Gulp instead A few might say their catchphrase but in an uncertain voice Some might even freeze in fear completely On the other hand other characters may react more with despair rather than fullon fear A few others may look to their equipment for a solution And finally for some it is the crowning moment of despairThe effectiveness of this moment can be affected by the difference between their usual competence and confidence levels and how completely they are boned Characters with low selfesteem or who are constantly crying out in terror are difficult but not impossible to make this trope work with and may react more along the lines of This Is Gonna Suck But that arrogant so far unbeatable supervillain suddenly realizing theyre about to have his or her ass royally kicked Now were talkingCan occur if one protagonist has been luring the other one into a trap or if they just have some shiny new skill Or they may simply be a lowerlevel villain whos just had the very bad luck to be confronted with a hero impossibly out of his or her league and is about to be on the wrong end of a CurbStomp BattleOn occasion they will be discussing the situation when they realize either the full import of it or worse that its about to happen to them Can also occur if a character speaks ill of another in a language they think the latter wont understand only to find out much to their horror that the latter also speaks itThis is the polar opposite of ObiWan Moment when despite the bad situation someone still manages to look composed May result in a Heroic BSoD for a heroic character or even a Villainous Breakdown for a villainous character Nine times out of ten this will immediately follow What Does This Button Do The remaining tenth follow some other temptation of fate Also a very common reaction when a villain normally The Chessmaster Villain with Good Publicity or Manipulative Bastard realizes theyve just been the victim of an Engineered Public ConfessionWhen this trope becomes literal thats Bring My Brown Pants—as Bill Cosby once said first you say it then you do itWhen most of the cast available in the scene does this expression its a Mass Oh Crap moment If someone tries to explain the situation to someone else and realizes halfway through their own explanation theyre in real trouble its Explain Explain Oh Crap If the person making the realization doesnt try to explain and says nothing but Run its time to Run or Die If you realize youre in trouble after your explanation or if someone tells you something really bad is about to happen and Oh Crap isnt your first reaction its a Delayed Oh Crap When you try to save some face by putting on a happy face you make an Oh Crap Smile When you pretend to realize you are in trouble only to mess with your opponent its an Oh Crap Fakeout When your primary reaction is resigned acceptance of the situation its This Is Gonna SuckSee also Wide Eyes and Shrunken Irises Say Your Prayers may be involved as part of this reactionContrast Hell Yes Moment the exact inverseWarning High risk of spoilersNo Real Life Examples Please,4021
Big Brother Instinct,If you made her cry start runningBig brothers you know why theyre born first To protect the little ones that come after them— Ichigo Kurosaki BleachOne very common way to establish that a male or increasingly frequently female character is a Nice Guy even if the niceness is hidden under a gruff exterior is to give them an instinctive desire to be a respectable big sibling to smaller or younger characters in more cases female than male These other characters may be truly younger siblings or they may be completely unrelated or even older but the feeling is the same to act as their protectorThe Big Brother Instinct serves to explain fan attraction to Moe tropes and devices as an emotional rather than sexual response There seems to be something inherently comforting to an awkward male about being looked up to by a younger girl for support Therefore Moe can be wish fulfillment about taking a big brother role instead of about being a Love Interest Rather amusingly its also quite often that the trope gets inverted and the younger sibling wants to protect the older instead Hilarity Ensues when both versions happen at the same timeIf both characters are male the older or in the case of twins the physically stronger brother will usually act as the youngersmaller brothers protector to the point of treating him like a child even when the younger brother is fully capable of protecting himself This behavior can come across as loving and nurturing or as condescending and smothering If the older brother goes to extreme morally questionable lengths for the sake of the younger sibling then they are a Knight Templar Big BrotherCompare Mama Bear Papa Wolf Family Man Extremely Protective Child My Sister Is OffLimits Promotion to Parent CompareContrast Big Brother Bully While the two may seem mutually exclusive at first glance they frequently overlap in both fiction and reality the same sibling who makes their little sisters life a constant parade of pranks may have a If You Ever Do Anything to Hurt Her conversation with her new boyfriend Also contrast with Disappointing Older Sibling when the character either lacks the Big Brother Instinct or is completely ineffectual at protecting the younger siblingHas nothing to do with the TV show Big Brother The 1984 meaning of Big Brother is covered under Big Brother Is Watching,2338

Conviction by Contradiction,You dont like the way I phrased an answer What kind of evidence is that— The guy who did it Monk Mr Monk Fights City HallThe classic whodunit challenges the viewer to solve the crime along with the detective Since the viewer isnt a professional the crime has to be set up so that the solution doesnt rely on skills only a licensed criminologist would have These mysteries often work by reducing the crime to a logic puzzle you solve the mystery by finding the fact that doesnt fitThe problem with this is the solution at the back of the book doesnt give the perp a chance to offer a perfectly reasonable explanationSo for example lets say the police are investigating a murder and Bob is their lead suspect Bob says that at the time of the murder he was attending a party and his friend Alice was there with him But wait It turns out that Alice was on vacation in a foreign country at the time so she couldnt have attended the party with BobIn fiction this is usually enough to prove Bobs guilt or at least cast serious suspicion on Bob In the real world of course this does not in any way mean that Bob committed murder Maybe Bob still attended the party but it was with his friend Charlie not Alice Maybe the party was on a different night or there was a second party that Alice did attend with Bob and Bob just misremembered Maybe he attended the party with a different person named Alice and for whatever reason answered the question only mentioning the first name Maybe Bob was lying because he was doing something embarrassing that still wasnt you know murderReal crimes arent logic puzzles and mere factual inconsistencies arent a substitute for hard evidence Poking holes in a suspects story might push a jury towards the edge but its not going to convince them by itself You might be able to Pull the Thread but on its own proving that the suspect lied about something doesnt prove he committed the crime especially if he has a Big Secret At best this kind of logic game can be used during Perp Sweating to get a confession At worst Detective Brown will arrest the perp immediately but Perry Mason wouldnt even break a sweat getting an acquittal from thatMore realistic examples focus on the investigative side where the contradiction satisfies the significantly lower standard of proof required to arrest someone and investigate them further rather than the much higher standard to convict them or on nonlegal contexts where the solution is just about swaying peoples opinions rather than meeting any rigorous standard of proof Some stories handwave this issue by having the contradiction lead to further investigation and the discovery of more concrete evidence In stories involving teenage perpetrators the crimes are often rather minor and the solution has them immediately confess when the contradiction is pointed out this is somewhat less plausible against adult suspects but even in Real Life plenty of people dont know their rights or make mistakes when pressedNote that in modern legal systems it is far more realistic to have this trope derail a prosecution both because the defense only needs to introduce the possibility of reasonable doubt which a contradiction in a witness statement often accomplishes and because the prosecution has the burden of having to prove their case A contradiction in the defenses alibi doesnt necessarily prove them guilty if the prosecution otherwise failed to make its case but for the prosecution even an entirely innocent mistake in a key witness statement can call the credibility of the entire statement into question and cause the case to collapseSee also Conviction by Counterfactual Clue which is when the flaw found to prove the suspects guilt is simply erroneous This overlaps with HyperAwareness  sometimes its just hyperawareness taken too far to the point of noticing details that logically shouldnt even be noteworthy Can lead to a minor Inferred Holocaust if logic dictates that the supposedly happy ending will lead to either a guilty character escaping or an innocent one being convicted These types of inferences often run afoul of Hanlons Razor blaming every flaw or contradiction on lies and conspiracy rather than say faulty memory or panicCompare I Never Said It Was Poison where the suspect demonstrates knowledge of a detail or two they shouldnt,4323

The Stool Pigeon, Oh he did so do it I saw him with my very own eyes So thereTheres a gentleman thats going round Turning the joint upside down Stool pigeon  hachachacha— Kid Creole and the Coconuts Stool PigeonThe tattletale The blabbermouth The squealer That nogood snitch You cant go through life without having the misfortune of coming across someone whos willing to rat you out and get you in troubleHowever the motivations of the snitch and how theyre regarded in a story can vary wildly Snitches have the reputation of being cowardly weasels but there are times when a snitch can be responsible or heroic if they report unethical or illegal activity done by authorities in this case they may be called a whistleblower Due to the sheer prevalence of this trope there are several important variationsPetty PattyPeter A character thats jealous of the main character or has a petty reason to dislike them and thus relishes the chance to get them in trouble You can usually spot them smiling smugly as the main character is chastised for whatever they did Naturally theyre going to get some paybackDisgruntled DariaDavey A character that dutifully gives information to their superiors but is then unsatisfied with how they deal with it If they wont listen to her then shell find someone who will This kind of snitch can vary wildly sometimes the authorities refuse to listen so they secretly tell someone else who will take action However sometimes the authorities are just acting in a way she doesnt like and thus is going to force their hand This latter variation can be considered treason and can cause internal strifeBetrayer BelindaBarry A character that sells out their own friends to save his own skin Maybe theyve gotten caught and offered a plea deal maybe the authorities are offering incentives or maybe theyre just jerks Either way this character can end up in a lot of trouble if their friends find out what they did Snobby SaraSimon A character that turns in any other character no matter what reasons they had for what they did They broke the rules so those little punks have to suffer the consequences This character doesnt care about justice or rules as much as they enjoy feeling smug and superior to othersObnoxious OliviaOscar A kid character that tattles on someone else for  well the thousands of reasons why kids like getting people in trouble Usually played for laughs but can sometimes be taken more seriously especially if the kid is a young whistleblower or is called a liarDrug DebbieDoug A character who ends up blabbing about activities to another person without realizing it because they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol Also a Truth in Television as drugged people or drunk people often blab the truth at the most inappropriate times due to their inhibitions being loosened Can sometimes fall under Lacerated Larry if the person was drugged as part of an interrogationObedient OlgaObadiah A character who spills the beans because he or she believes this is what a good citizen ought to do without any personal grudges or strained relationships Because they hold no grudges such a person simply blabs and immediately moves on They may believe obedience to authority to be a virtue and any defiance of it is inherently wrong They are neither The Mole nor a spy They never had anything to do with whomever they ratted out in the first place but simply discovered them and reported them the same way one might report a suspicious package to the policeand more sympatheticallyInnocent IngridIsaac A character who along with other characters has been involved in some activities that have gone rapidly downhill and turns them in because of this Maybe they never wanted to do anything bad but suddenly found themself caught up with people prepared and willing to do so maybe their coconspirators began doing things that they cannot stand or maybe they honestly didnt know that their friends or coworkers were doing anything wrong and upon finding out decide to turn them inConcerned ClaireCorey A character that turns in a friend or associate out of genuine concern for their wellbeing Maybe their friend is sliding towards becoming a WellIntentioned Extremist maybe theyre compromising their cause or maybe theyre going to land themselves in jail or worse This character is willing to nobly take any hostility from their friend because theyd rather see them alive and safe than continue what they were doing Whether their concern is responsible or misguided can varyWhistleblower WilmaWilson A character who sees a villain  or even a hero  breaking the rules and turns them in because of their own moral conscience The most heroic of all snitches many whistleblowers risk their friendships careers or even their lives to tell the truthLacerated LaceyLarry A character that was simply interrogated to the point of having the information tortured out of them In many cases the person may have been an extremely loyal comrade and in normal circumstances would not have ratted out their team But since Torture Always Works and the coldhearted villains have ways of making victims talk the captured member will always be left screaming in the endSnitches vary from Gossipy Hens because theyre actually telling the truth and usually telling it to a recognised authority whether its a parent or the government This can lead to a lot of problems because no matter how much of a jerk a snitch might be the characters wouldnt have gotten in trouble if they hadnt done something snitchworthy in the first placeSee

Just Following Orders,Hans are we the baddiesBefehl ist Befehl lit An order is an order— Thousands of defendants to British French Soviet and US military courts 194548 Czechoslovak Hungarian and Polish civilian courts 194548 the International Military Tribunal at Nürnberg 194546 and German civilian courts 19482016Just Following Orders is a justification for morally questionable actions that a character may invoke when questioned about the rightness or necessity of such actions This justification holds that the bulk of the responsibility for such actions falls upon those who make such decisions and give such orders within a military hierarchy by extension those who obey and act upon such orders cannot be held entirely accountable for their actions Often invoked with the exact phrase I was Just Following Orders Also known as the Nuremberg Defense because a notable flaw of the immediate postwar German penal code was that the worst category of murder and its attendant sentences firstdegree murder could only be for base motives hatred bloodlust greed etc which did not include dispassionate participation in mass murdernote This was subject to an Obvious Rule Patch later on Modern laws tend to distinguish between degrees of murder according to prior intentplanning instead with ones emotional or rational reasons for the murders taking a backseat Indeed Common Law does not distinguish between types of murder at all though the motivations do of course affect the sentencing Perpetrator testimony and the Milgram Experimentnote  More specifically the series of experiments in which the test subject operated alongside two other test subjects actors and in the absence of supervision from the scientist running the experiment Interestingly the very best results in compliance neartotal were reached in the series where the test subjects were asked to perform tasks that only enabled the shocks to be administered such as setting the dial on the shock machine to a level indicated by the scientist  indicate that even when the desire to conform with the group is a major or primary reason for someone carrying out an immoral group action they almost always frame their compliance in terms of obedience to authority They believed that obedience to authority at least partly justified or excused immoral behavior and that desire to conform did notAccordingly Just Following Orders is the Stock Phrase mottomantradefense of the PunchClock Villain as well as most bureaucrats obstructive or otherwise Mooks and just about anyone during failures of nerve job security heroic fortitudeIt seems justifiable if you put yourself in their shoes One is legally trapped between the prospect of immediate punishment from national law or possibly delayed punishment from an international court attempting to judge from a higher moral law If your life andor your familys life was threatened if you disobeyed orders you knew to be morally reprehensible what would you do This was the choice presented to the Hiwis conscripted from Soviet POW and civilians Jewish Police recruited by the Jewish Councils from the ghetto populations and Sonderkommando recruited from Extermination Camp inmates This is why the surviving Hiwis Jewish Police and Sonderkommando were never tried for War Crimes or Crimes Against Humanity but some of the senior commanders of the German troops who supervised them volunteers legally and practically entitled to opt out as many did wereThe sympathy of the victims of such atrocities to the troubles of their persecutors is of course not a givenThis trope is by now usually not played straight but instead cowardly ironically sarcastically or selfhatingly Still its one of the tropes that cycles between Dead Horse Trope and Undead Horse Trope because the dilemma it rests on is close to unresolvable Quoting the trope by name though is likely to be met with skepticism and ridicule If the crime being excused is a relatively minor one though then an accuser invoking a parallel with Nuremberg may be seen as invoking Godwins LawOften the de facto justification of those who believe in My Master Right or Wrong or My Country Right or Wrong or I Did What I Had to Do If taken to extremes it can result in Blind Obedience A Lawful Neutral may well end up saying this at some point depending on who he serves If a person has no choice but to blindly obey orders thats I Dont Pay You to ThinkContrast Just Giving Orders Wont Do Your Dirty Work and Disobeyed Orders Not Punished Not to be mistaken for Think Nothing of It or All a Part of the Job catchphrases associated with the Humble Hero Also not for when its said by someone whos Bothering by the Book If the villain literally has no clue that the order they follow would cause harm it may overlap with Obliviously Evil,4767

Big NO,Do not wantIts mine Its all mine I— Where is it No NOOOOOOOOO— Jafar AladdinThe moment when a character realizes that something awful has happened or notices that something awful is about to happen and screams NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO It can also be used when a character angrily refuses to do somethingIf the character is rushing to prevent the somethingawful from happening a slowmotion effect can be employed to draw out the tension of the moment sometimes to the point of drawing out the No into a comical bass growl This trope is very susceptible to becoming Narm but does raise the question of exactly how a character should handle a crisis without coming off as a psychotic by going catatonic a monster by cracking a grim joke or a pottymouth by swearing ones head offUsed both seriously and for comic effect Very common on sitcoms Sometimes the Big NO ends the episode with a CliffhangerNearing the point of becoming Narm and a Discredited Trope though a good actor can still pull it off Some variants still have credibility including a shorter but still intense No and a panicked No no no no no Or you can just go for the simpler Skyward Scream Occasionally the character will shout something other than No — usually shouting the name of the character that something bad is about to happen or has just happened to This is slightly less discredited On the whole however this trope is usually a reliable indicator of Ham and CheeseLanguage matters a lot For example Big NO is commonly played straight in Japanese media due to the equivalent iyas higher screamabilitynote It literally means unpleasant but is usually translated no when in line with this trope Sonna can also be used depending on screamability But not very common in Russian due to the equivalent nyets very low screamabilityBecause Evil Is Hammy often the Big Bad is the one who screams the Big NO usually as their plans are crashing down around their ears And also usually the last thing the villain ever saysOften combined with a Futile Hand Reach Sometimes followed by a dramatic and very rapid zooming out to the whole block Or Eat the CameraLarge Hams will pull out a Giant NO if given the opportunityA SubTrope of Big Word ShoutA Sister Trope to Slow NOContrast Big YES Compare Little No Big NEVER RapidFire No Comical Overreacting Death Wail Big OMG Big WHY Howl of Sorrow Say My Name and Atomic FBombNot to be confused with a certain mecha series with a similarsounding titleSee here for a hilariously useful InstantNooooHere is a compilation with a lot of examples of this trope,2552
Unexpectedly Dark Episode,You have a work thats generally a comedy or at least played less than seriously Suddenly the Black Comedy is more black than comic the Heroic Comedic Sociopath or seemingly Harmless Villains actions are played dead seriously half the cast is dead and it turns out that the Plucky Comic Relief has a horrific backstoryThis episode will likely have a Downer Ending or at least a bittersweet one Black Comedy may also become this if more emphasis is placed on the Black than on the Comedy or if themes previously played for laughs are treated seriouslyThis isnt necessarily a sign of Cerebus Syndrome since the comedic tone may return after the Unexpectedly Dark Episode but it may not These may also be Very Special Episodes if they also tackle a serious Real Life issue in the process It is however likely to be a Wham Episode It may lead to Cerebus Syndrome if there are multiple episodes like this or a Sudden Downer Ending if it happens at the end All thats required is that a usually comic or upbeat series suddenly includes a very serious episodeContrast Breather Episode where a serious show has a comparatively light episode Compare Mood Whiplash and Wham Episode where the shift isnt necessarily to Darker and Edgier but often is and How Unscientific in which a show generally grounded in reality suddenly has a supernaturalbased episode The two tropes may go together in a Halloween EpisodeFor an unexpectedly dark villain see Vile Villain Saccharine Show For the noncanon versions see Dark Fic and Dark Parody For when only one scene is dark but the rest of it is still comedic see Comedic Work Serious Scene,1617
Vomit Discretion Shot,And we couldnt even see it Camilo couldnt take it and vomited over the side of the ship Just hearing what was happening behind them was too much for his stomach— Dragons Butterflies And Who Knows What Else Chapter 5 SeveredVomit in television often has a surprising knack for avoiding the camera usually from either actors running offscreen to be sick the scene cutting away to something else spewing like a burst pipe or the character just dropping off camera when they double over The Vomiting Cop usually exhibits this behaviorOften done as a way of Getting Crap Past the Radar although ironically The Hays Code that was in effect for Hollywood movies between 1934 and 1968 made no mention of vomiting or any other bodily functions This was primarily because the censors took it for granted that filmmakers themselves found bodily fluids so disgusting that they wouldnt want to put them in their movies Well some of these filmmakers did want thatThere is a scientificallyexplainable reason why vomiting usually isnt shown onscreen in media Human evolution resulted in nausea being about as contagious as yawning is as back during the huntergatherer days it was very likely that any poisonous material that someone ate was also eaten by other members of their group Thus seeing someone throw up will result in one instinctively feeling nauseous as well consequently vomiting is considered one of the most universally reviled natural actions to bear witness to explaining its frequent onscreen absenceInvert it with Vomit Indiscretion Shot when the gory details of vomiting are explicit,1587

Rule of Funny,Eddie You mean to tell me that you could have taken your hand out of that cuff at any time Roger No not at any time Only when it was funny— Who Framed Roger RabbitThe limit of the Willing Suspension of Disbelief for a given element is directly proportional to its funninessAny violation of continuity logic physics or common sense is permissible if the result gets enough of a laughThis is the comedy equivalent of the Rule of Cool and is accordingly weighted more in comedy shows Especially easy to invoke in humorbased American animation and Webcomics where people expect the lack of realism in the art to translate to other areasRule of Funny is not a superpower One of the characteristics of the rule of funny is that it can give some abilities to a character to the sole purpose of a gag which means the character just CANT do that when its not funny For instance Wile E Coyote frequently walks on thin air because he hasnt noticed that hes at the edge of a cliff and he falls when he notices it It is Rule of Funny Wile E cant walk on thin air as a previewed part of a schemeCompare Rule of Fun,1100
Amazing Technicolor Wildlife,Guess why they call her BlueOoh they look like Skittles— Homer Simpson commenting on painted rats in Rio de Janeiro The SimpsonsSometimes humans in animation and video games have decidedly nonstandard skin colors Instead of being tan and brown theyll be green grey and purple But theyre not the only ones — sometimes animators have a bit of fun when designing animals as well And thus the world is filled with Amazing Technicolor WildlifeAnimals are a bit different from humans — a lot of them do come in wilder more flamboyant colors especially in tropical areas Animals use bright colors as a way of saying Dont eat me Im poisonous or Look at me Arent I a sexy beast or even for reasons were not quite sure of However not all animals come in different colors — a lot of mammals tend to be the same grayish and yellowish and brownish and reddish colors we humans are with the brightest colors reserved for birds insects and fish A few reptiles here and there too And while no one would bat their eye at a blue peacock with green tail feathers a red peacock with bright purple tailfeathers would be distinctly more unusual For instance there is no green in mammals unless you count fur tinted green because of algae and blue is only found in a few mammal species unless you count greyishblue or a blue sheen It just doesnt exist naturally since there are no pigments in mammal furhair that can produce these colors many mammals also have poor color vision to begin with so brightlycolored fur wouldnt have much of an evolutionary advantage in reality Funny Animals in particular seem to be prone to thisSometimes animators exaggerate the range of colors patterns and markings found on each species of animal in Real Life Several species of penguin like the Fairy Penguin◊ have a naturally blue sheen to their feathers but many animated penguins tend to be bright blue There are other accepted variants from the range of colors markings and patterns each species of animal can have in Real Life like solidcolored nontabby red catsOther times theyre outright strange Blue dogs pink rabbits orange sharks and tealcolored platypodes aboundLittle songbirds which are dullcolored in Real Life may be depicted as brightly colored in a more subtle version crows and ravens are often shown with yellow beaks and feet though retaining their allblack plumage modern works however will show them with gray beaks and feet insteadCan be subject to Hair Color Dissonance where the unnatural color is adjusted to something more natural by the viewers brain Completely unrelated to Pink Elephants although this trope may cause people to think that that trope or Mushroom Samba is in play,2670

Catapult Nightmare,My sleeping bag is trying to eat meAny person awaking from a nightmare must sit bolt upright in bed and scream— Hollywood Rule Book Vanity FairWhenever a character awakes from a nightmare in fiction they will fling themselves to a leaning or sitting position panting and looking around frantically and maybe even screaming despite this being rather implausible in Real LifeThink carefully how many times do you remember waking up from a nightmare by flinging your torso upwards Probably never right Most people might pant look confused and take a few seconds to check their surroundings and get reoriented But actually flinging themselves upright is laughable The most youll likely get is a gasp and a fullbody twitch or some odd moaning coupled with sleep paralysis although children may wake up screaming However because these actions are small and dont come across very easily on camera works of visual mediums employ this tropeThis does happen occasionally in the real world but usually its because someone is startled by an outside sensation like a loud noise not a nightmare Most of the time certain chemicals secreted while falling asleep prevent the sleeper from acting out their dreams a condition known as sleep paralysis which stops us from hurting ourselves in our sleep This extends to shortly before falling asleep or just after waking up The rare times it does happen in real life involve a neurological disorder where the person is woken up from the dream by a sensation not the other way around Such sufferers often describe the feeling as being pushed upright Nevertheless the Catapult Nightmare happens every single time in fiction If its a Dream Within a Dream expect two Possibly more Sometimes this trope is Played for Laughs especially if the dream they were having was particularly silly or they catapult in an overthetop or silly way Its just as often Played for Drama to show how a character has been traumatized by a particular incident with their guilt manifesting as someone who hurt them or someone they failed to helpA night terror can have this effect but it doesnt involve waking up and doesnt involve a dream—just fullon activation of the fightorflight system in the middle of the deepest stages of sleep People who have them usually dont remember it in the morning but witnessing such an incident as a bystander can be both physically and psychologically traumatic,2399
Abusive Parents,Yelling at her to shut up is actually one of the nicest things Peter has done to MegIf my son talked like that Id beat him to within an inch of his life Id whip him senseless with my belt and hold his head in the toilet till he was begging for mercy I still dont see why the judge cut off my visitation rights— Sosumi Ultimate MuscleParents are supposed to be the protectors of children but these parents are either so damaged themselves that they cant do the job greedy or villainous to the point that they never had any interest in doing the job properly or would rather use the child as a means to an end Sometimes theyre just sadistic assholesThis includes parents who are emotionally verbally physically or mentally abusive or who neglectfully allow their children to be abused by others if they dont abuse the child themselves sexual abuse in particular is typically treated as a special kind of evil Sometimes the abuse at the hands of their parents becomes a Freudian Excuse for a villain Other times the character manages to not grow up broken bitter and hateful and instead a different and better person than the upbringing would incline one to think they may even pass down their newfound betterment to their own children Troubling Unchildlike Behavior is often a telltale sign that things are not right at homeAbusive Parents are commonplace in fairy tales and Classical Mythology which makes this trope Older Than Feudalism Note that The Brothers Grimm when they collected European fairy tales were uncomfortable with the idea of Abusive Parents and so frequently changed the Abusive Parents in the traditional stories into abusive stepparentsSometimes a parent will go as far as to kill the child in question in which case this is Offing the Offspring In other ways cases the parents abuse occasionally drives the offspring to snap commit Revenge and finally kill them thus becoming a SelfMade Orphan Although other times the parents end up as aKarma Houdini Calling the Old Man Out occurs when a fedup child retaliates with a The Reason You Suck Speech If the child gets out of the broken family and forms healthy friendships but reacts badly when their abusive parents show up again well Friends Are Chosen Family ArentBear in mind that not everyone agrees on the line between actual abuse and merely heavyhanded parenting or even normal parenting Is Moving the Goalposts merely inspiring the child to achieve more or the most insidious form of abuse to instill mistrust and paranoia in the children Some include spanking as abuse others think its appropriate given certain guidelines Some believe its okay to make a kid go without a meal they wont starve that easily others disagree Making a kid miss a friends birthday sleepover — is that emotional abuse Raising a kid without exposure to TV Telling your daughter shes getting fat A little namecalling Theres a line here somewhere but not everyone agrees on where it isIf a parent has just dumped the child for whatever reason thats Parental Abandonment if they arent paying attention thats Parental Neglect If the parents refuse to discipline their kids they are Pushover Parents Contrast Mama Bear and Papa Wolf where others abuse the children and the parents abuse the abusers the more extreme variant of Knight Templar Parent where the abusive parent is violently overprotective and Abusive Offspring where the children are abusive to their parents Abusive Precursors can be considered this on a metaphorical level See Hilariously Abusive Childhood for when this is cranked up to absurd levels and Played for Laughs Black Comedy is often connected in the comedic aspect of it and a Big ScrewedUp Family may be involved if it is adult comedy In keeping with the above note some may call the show on it and say Dude Not Funny See Evil Matriarch and Archnemesis Dad for characters who are beyond abusive and outright evil Abusivetype parents are mostly wanted criminals being chased by the law For grandparents who abuse their grandchildren see Gruesome GrandparentWhile they do not have to be the childs actual technical parents to be part of this trope they must be closely related and live together like a Wicked Stepmother or an Evil Uncle taking care of the Parentally Deprived After all its much more disgusting that somebody related to the child could bring themselves to hurt them rather than a mere foster familyAs in Real Life this trope can make a child Hate Their ParentIf the abused child insists that their parents are good people despite their mistreatment its Delusions of Parental LoveWhen the abused child in question grows up and starts their own family they will sometimes bow not to make the same mistakes their parents did with them and will try to treat their own children better with the hopes of Breaking the Cycle of Bad Parenting The psychological damage of abusive parenting can lead to Conditioned to Be Weak where the abused child is too scared of their abuser to retaliate so they just follow orders to avoid their wrathThe polar opposite of course is Good Parents Also not to be confused with Teasing Parent who plays harmless jokes on their kids without intending to hurt themUnfortunately Abusive Parents are Truth in Television and a very sensitive topic for many so No Real Life Examples Please It is sufficient to say they do exist and that they are also too common,5371

Nothing Is Scarier,There is absolutely nothing to fearThe oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown— H P LovecraftSilence Is Golden Except when it isntThis is a Horror trope where fear isnt induced by a traumatic visual element or by a physical threat but by the sole lack of event When properly done it can result in terrifying moments It does so for one simple reason the creator refuses to show us just what it is thats causing this horror but we desperately wish to know so our imagination fills in the blanks and our minds provide the content using whatever the individual considers scaryIt often has to do with where the events are happening generally because said place is inherently scary but sometimes merely because of the way it is filmed or describedThis trope comes in three flavors The classic version where the moment serves to build up suspense and tension until something scary suddenly jumps at you from elsewhere It has been done a million times and is often poorly executed ending up with the killermonsterwhatever apparition being less scary than the preceding sequencenote Stephen King once said that the actual presence of the big scary thing itself tends to be the cause of the letdown — whatever they actually show is unlikely to be worse than what we were expecting Even if it is its not going to have nearly as much impact on a viewer whos been anticipating it for the last minute or so Many times what the directors do is make the character look around with some small light source flashlight cellphone camera flashes for a mysterious noise then turn around right when the suspense reaches its peak Of course they sigh when they see nothing and then they turn around again and WHAM Both of these methods alternate between being the norm in that they can still keep the tension high even when expected The full version is when there really is nothing happening but the result can be several magnitudes scarier than the classic version because the audience is left to imagine what could have happened The third variation is where theres nothing there nothing there nothing there and then you realize there is something there and its been there all along Perhaps the most common method of showing this is Nobody Here but Us Statues when not played for comedy Another variant which has admittedly become discredited as Technology Marches On is The Calls Are Coming from Inside the HouseScare chords and cues may be used to reinforce the effect but it seems to work best when theres no music at all The camera might slowly close in on the nothing either as a character musters the courage to open the door enter the dark depths or cowers abjectly at the impenetrable darknessThis trope can be used in combination with several other tropes Through the Eyes of Madness Darkness Equals Death Quieter Than Silence Leave the Camera Running Mind Screw Kill the Lights and Obscured Special Effects are some examples Since the space is empty it may also appear as a part of Space Madness usually as the second variant Anything will do as long as the result is scary Paranoia Fuel is a nearmustIn Real Life this trope is why its terrifying to walk through a familiar dark room by yourself through the woods or a secluded street at night This is one horror trope everyone is familiar with Its also a reason why the Silent Treatment can be an especially damaging punishment both emotionally and sometimes even physically Sensory deprivation can result in panic attacks or even visualauditory hallucinations for some people as the lack of stimuli makes the subconscious mind hungry for input causing the brain to create its own to fill in the gapCompare and contrast And I Must Scream Cat Scare Creepy Basement Gory Discretion Shot Jump Scare Monster Delay Unseen Evil and The Unreveal One of the counterarguments against leaving nothing to the imagination and sometimes an argument against Gorn as well Dead Air can be this for radio The Spook and the Diabolus ex Nihilo are often characterized by this tropeInterestingly this is probably what makes people afraid of whatever The New Rock  Roll isNot to be confused with Nothing Exciting Ever Happens Here Empty Room Psych or Its Quiet Too Quiet Contrast Nothing Is Funnier where leaving details to the viewers imagination is used for comedic effectExample Subpages Anime  Manga Fan Works Films  LiveAction Literature LiveAction TV Music Video Games Web Original Western Animation,4495

Expy Coexistence,The Supermen of the multiverseWow you know Lucius Sweet Hes exactly as rich and as famous as Don King and he looks just like him too— Homer Simpson The Simpsons The Homer They FallOften a show uses an Expy to create an original take or a legal shortcut on a character a company a franchise a person or any entity In many of them they might exist as a Captain Ersatz of the original or just to be an equivalent but original take on an entity It is always implied that they are the replacement for that entity in that universe but sometimes it turns out that last statement is not true In other words this is an aversion of the Celebrity Paradox inuniverseIn this trope an Expy lives alongside the original characters and nothing is weird about that If there is a gang of famous characters he might be part of that gang in that shows universe These are common in animated shows that straddle the line between cartoon and reality such as Animaniacs and Drawn Together They may often be said to be a fan a friend or a hated rival of the real person whom they are an Expy ofAlso if this story takes place in our universe and it is established that the Expy and the original both exist as fictional entities that would raise the question as to why the creator has not sent a ceaseanddesist letter or sued them for everything they haveNote this trope does not apply when the character is NOT an Expy of a famous character but hangs out with famous characters or people For example in The Critic Jay Sherman is a famous TV film critic who is friends with other famous reallife critics like Gene Siskel Roger Ebert Gene Shalit Rex Reed etc But because Jay is not intended to be a direct take on any of them this trope does not apply Compare and contrast with LawyerFriendly Cameo Celebrity Paradox and Mutually Fictional If the original starts to trashtalk the expy when they run into them thats Knocking the Knockoff,1908
Kick the Dog,Wouldbe Dictator Murderer Kidnapper Terrorist Puppy punterIn the old days villains had moustaches and kicked the dog Audiences are smarter today They dont want their villain to be thrown at them with green limelight on his face They want an ordinary human being with failings— Alfred HitchcockWhen a character does something evil cruel or very mean for no apparent gain because the author wants to demonstrate that they are not a nice person and shift audience sympathy away from themWhy this trope works could be expressed in the words of William Cowper I would not enter on my list of friends though graced with polished manners and fine sense yet wanting sensibility the man who needlessly sets foot upon a worm In other words a cruel act no matter how trivial establishes someone as a cruel person Conversely the creator may show a character being kind for no apparent gain to demonstrate that the character is a nice person and someone the audience is meant to cheer for Both devices are used to help the audience become emotionally invested in the storyWhat separates this trope from a characters other evil or cruel acts is that this bit of evil is gratuitous It doesnt get the character anything or even advance the plot The sole reason for this story beat existing is to place one or more characters squarely on the wrong side of the Rule of EmpathyDogkickings can be verbal as well when a line of dialogue is used to shock the audience with its sheer repugnance If its uttered in the presence of the hero in an action series theyll echo the audiences thoughts and tell the villain Youre InsaneNeedless to say this trope can be enacted without harming any dogs Any act or statement that shows the characters meanness or outright evil will do such as a boss demanding an employee come in to work during Christmas when the employees kid is in the hospital or a passerby stealing from a blind beggars coin dish or The Dragon inflicting a vicious NoHoldsBarred Beatdown on the hero or one of their True Companions or Protectorate A Politically Incorrect Villain can kick the dog by showing gratuitous racism sexism homophobia or some combination of such nonPC traits If the event happened off screen in the past just have Bob fondly recall the incident and make it clear that he has no remorse whatsoever Bingo mission accomplishedIf the evil act is directed toward an animal however a dog is usually the victim of choice partly out of connotations of blind loyalty partly from tradition Arguably however substituting a cat can be even more shocking After all even bad guys like cats So the argument goes if Bob goes out of his way to harm one he must really be a bastardThis trope is common in horrorbased Monster of the Week shows often to set up the Asshole Victim for the Karmic Twist Ending Anthologies are especially prone to this as they have to set up their villains really quickly since they have only one episode to tell their story This can be played up by having the very same kick of cruelty be the cause of their downfall At the very least it is designed to let you know who is going to lose at the end The opposite of Karma HoudiniIn cartoons someone who does this can be legally harassed by Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck or the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot A troll like Screwy Squirrel however wont wait that longOne possible origin of the trope name comes from Westerns where three bandits would ride into the town one would shoot the Sheriff one would shoot the Deputy and one just to prove he was also a bad guy would Kick The DogIf what is supposed to be a characters Kick The Dog moment is excessively horrible cruel or otherwise despicable enough to make an audience lose all sympathy for them then theys crossed the Moral Event Horizon if theys not on the other side of it already If the Dog in question is someone the character cares about and discovers Being Evil Sucks then theyve Kicked the Morality Pet and might be in time to avoid a FaceHeel Turn If the dog belonged to a minion expect it to help cause a MookFace Turn because Even Mooks Have Loved Ones On occasions if karma works in the dogs favor theyll manage to get a last laugh On even rarer occasions after being pushed around too many times the dog may decide to plan against the Big Bad for his own ambitions because Being Tortured Makes You Evil When the dogkicking is done in a way that usually inadvertently increases sympathy for the villain it becomes Strawman Has a Point If the character appears to be likable or sympathetic when introduced and the dogkicking proves that they is actually evil that is Bait the Dog If the villain shoots for this trope but fails to actually do anything seriously evil its Poke the PoodleOf course the crux of this trope isnt just the cruel act its also about the innocence of the victim ie they have done nothing to warrant their abuse If the target is an Asshole Victim instead the cruel act can become a sympathetic one for the villainantihero instead If going after the Acceptable Target is a coincidence it becomes LaserGuided Karma if the victim was specifically targeted for their assholery it becomes Pay Evil unto EvilKicking the Dog is also done for no practical reason apart from the metareason of demonstrating the dark side of the kicker If the perpetrator does it because they care about their victim and want to help them somehow theyre being Cruel to Be Kind if their actions have a broader purpose à la doing what had to be done theyre trying to Shoot the Dog thats what you do when Old Yeller has rabies after allThis trope is often used to counter or prevent a character from being seen by the audience as a Designated Villain or Strawman Has a Point These tropes tend to occur when poor writing or characterization causes a character to become more sympathetic to the viewers than intended Since the writers cant just give these villains their just desserts if the audience likes them too much or prefers to take their side on an issue an effective Kick the Dog moment can make them lose their sympathy and make them punishable again This can backfire though as the audience may decide that the villain still has a point and that the writers are forcibly making them look bad through gratuitous dogkicking rather than seriously addressing their pointsA sign that Evil Is Petty Compare with Cant Get Away with Nuthin And Your Little Dog Too Kick Them While They Are Down The Dog Bites BackThrew My Bike on the Roof I Will Punish Your Friend for Your Failure See If Youre So Evil Eat This Kitten for when bad guys do a Kick The Dog test to make sure undercover heroes are really evil and DogKicking Excuse for when the wouldbe dogkicker has to psych themselves up to doing

PaperThin Disguise,But grandma what a horrible disguise you have Image by Scott GustafsonMr Burns it was naïve of you to think Id mistake this towns most prominent 104yearold man for one of my elementary school students— Principal Skinner The SimpsonsA disguise that is so thin that the audience can immediately recognize who the person behind the mask actually is Note that this doesnt require an actual mask the character may have merely styled their hair differently added glasses or changed into a different outfit Regardless of exactly what was used for the disguise the identity of the character is completely clear usually before they remove it and sometimes other characters can see through it as well Any character who is fooled is likely a Horrible Judge of Character the egregiousness of their misjudgment depends on the disguiseSeveral external factors influence this trope If the bigname Special Guest is going to spend most of the episode or film wearing a disguise then youd want it to be thin enough for audiences to identify the actor before The Reveal If the character frequently wears disguises then it may be a stylistic choice to reassure the audience as to the identity of the character This is more common in media aimed at younger audiences but is also common enough for Master of Disguise characters so that the audience isnt constantly guessing as to which character is really in disguise The trope is still an important dramatic convention in live theatre and opera productions — where a really good disguise would render the character unidentifiable from the cheap seats and be beyond the scope of the prop budget to boot — but is usually employed along with some kind of nod to the audience acknowledging the absurdityInternal story factors also apply If the disguised character is supposed to be foolish wearing a bad disguise provides plenty of opportunity for comedy particularly if other characters arent fooled any more than the audience A character who cant identify someone just because they added sunglasses to their ensemble is another way to mock disguises as well as genre conventionsClassic examples of bad disguises are the following tropes are linked based on their overlap not subtrope status Wearing a faceobscuring cloak or hat over the characters standard outfit Wearing a Groucho Marx glassesandmustache prop Putting on or taking off glassessunglasses Changing out of a Limited Wardrobe especially into a uniformed service such as police officers or package delivery employeesIf the disguise is improved such as by combining two or more thin details and changing your voice you get an example of Wig Dress Accent where the inability of the other characters to identify the disguised character becomes much more reasonable In order to qualify as a PaperThin Disguise there must be at least one obviously clear element of the character underneath However the probability that other characters are fooled by this disguise is just as fluid as with other disguise tropesIts becoming a bit common nowadays to subvert this trope by fooling the viewers instead showing what seems to be a terrible disguise but then its revealed that it isnt you thought that Bob was badly disguised as an old man but then Bob in regular clothes appears next to that old man that looks like himCompare with Clark Kenting a subtrope where the disguise is used over a long period of time and remains effective despite that and NewspaperThin Disguise where a book magazine or similar is used to hide a characters face Supertrope to Easy Impersonation and a subtrope of Blatant Lies May lead to a Captain Obvious Reveal,3618

Belly Dancer,Those hips dont lieThe philosophers soul dwells within his head the poets soul dwells within his heart the singers soul dwells about his throat but the soul of the dancer abides in all her body— Khalil Gibran The WandererTypically a woman who wears a midriffrevealing outfit harem pants and a lot of jewelry and sequins She moves her hips and stomach in a way that can mesmerize onlookers Occasionally men belly dance too but this is less common and may be Played for Laughs or Fan DisserviceOften occurs in Middle Eastern settings Serious performers of the sophisticated genuine article began to refer to it as Middle Eastern Dance in the 1980s Strictly speaking what Westerners think of as belly dancing is the Arabic raqs sharqi style Some historians believe it was a way of exercising the muscles of the pelvis and abdominal area for women who were pregnant or had menstruation problems or that it was part of a religious ceremony Nowadays its more for entertainment purposes with titilation of their loved one being the reason some women pick it up even today although it can be utilized as a form of exercise too The style has spread from Egypt and Turkey to Western countriesNote that the revealing outfits are a more recent addition to the dance female dancers of the original raqs sharqi style dressed more conservativelyIf a character dresses like a belly dancer but is not actually one she is a Bedlah BabePlease place only particularly notable reallife examples in the Real Life section,1498
Eureka Moment,Yup Criminals are the superstitious onesWilson Ive just given you the answer havent I And now youre going to walk out of here without saying a word House walking out the door Nope— House episode JoyAll complex problems are solved by sudden epiphanyIn every Locked Room Mystery the detective cant solve the crime just by examining the relevant evidence They always need some external inspiration apparently completely unrelated to everything something along the lines ofSharona Oh well looks like you dont solve the crime Whatever Lets go get milkshakes Monk Milkshakes The killer is lactose intolerant So is the victims exwife Of courseorBob No tea please Dave Thats how that letter found its way twenty miles to a dead man in SudburyCan take the form of a FlashbackMontage Realization and will lead directly to The Summation unless theres an Evidence Scavenger Hunt in between Often the character having the epiphany will tell the person whose offhand remark inspired it that theyre a genius or the like the remarker will then variously nod in a befuddled manner ask Im what or simply demand an explanation A character who wants clarification about what they just heard will often ask the other person to Repeat What You Just SaidNamed for perhaps the most famous nondetective related example Archimedes exclamation of Eureka after jumping into a bath and realizing that held the key to the problem he was trying to solve See below for detailsThe Eureka Moment shows up a lot on diagnosismystery medical shows such as House in which he does it in nearly every episode and in the first episode of Greys Anatomy which isnt even a medical detective show It may also show up on telenovelas or soap operas with some ongoing secret that defines a character or even the main plot The truth is often almost revealed several times by easily overheard conversations or weak evidence and each time the status quo is kept with some contrived explanation When the Eureka Moment takes place The Reveal is not the result of a confession or an evidence that is too solid to be ignored but instead the result of the hero putting all the small hints together and figuring out the truth by himself In this case expect a wave of several flashbacks of those hints before the EurekaNot to be confused with a Bat Deduction While both can initially appear almost identical a Eureka Moment leads to a coherent chain of reasoning that the detective can explain to the bystanders later whereas a Bat Deduction if it gets explained at all makes even less sense after the explanation However although logically sound the Eureka Moment may be enough to convince the one who came to it but not to convince others specially a court of law In this case the character may began a quest to obtain a Smoking Gun to prove things beyond any reasonable doubtOften used as a Deus ex Machina albeit one that is acceptable more often than annoying If the detective actually takes the idea literally rather than using it as an inspiration that is I Was Just Joking Can even happen in your sleep with Dreaming the TruthCompare LuckBased Search Technique and You Were Trying Too Hard See Placebo Eureka Moment for when there wasnt any external inspiration but they act like there was and Love Epiphany when the insight gained is that one party loves the other See also Explain Explain Oh Crap for a similar situation where instead of finding a solution someone becomes aware of a problem,3443
Badly Battered Babysitter,I thinkIm getting the hang of thisThe baby was EXPLODING You ever sat an exploding baby before Mr Dicker— Kari McKeen JackJack AttackOne of the classic comedy plots most often seen in cartoons A babysitter is left in charge of an infant who despite being so young turns out to be incredibly mobile As soon as the infants parents are offstage the babysitter begins a gauntlet of pain and anguish of which somehow the infant is the ultimate causeThere are some common variations The baby may wander away from the home with the babysitter giving chase In others the baby itself turns the home into an obstacle course of doom using the furnishings appliances water pipes electrical outlets and pretty much everything else in the house Or it is possible that the baby is unusual in some way and thus is physically dangerous and will inadvertently or not so inadvertently hurt the babysitter in the course of playing Regardless in the end grievous bodily harm comes to the babysitter and quite often the home itself is wrecked but the baby itself is safe and sound and utterly unhurtWhen the parents — who frankly should be locked up for negligence — return home they are either totally unaware that anything untoward has happened or chastise the babysitter for something trivial like tracking mud on the carpet not knowing that the sitter has suffered massive Amusing Injuries keeping their child safeA version of the story below goes right back to ancient Welsh folklore — making this trope Older Than PrintNote that the babysitter need not be an actual babysitter nor the infant an actual infant This trope works any time a supposedly responsible individual is left in charge of an innocent and ends up paying for it physicallyCompare No Sympathy Escort Mission and Stealth Escort Mission when the babysitter must ensure their charge is unaware there was any danger in the first place and Dreaded Kids Party Entertainer Job Can overlap with Baby Morph Episode if the baby used to be olderThe charge in question is usually a Babysitters Nightmare Babysitter from Hell is the inversion of this trope but this trope sometimes comes into play as a karmic punishment It also works the other way around See also Babysitter Friendship where the child the babysitter looks after is one of their best friends,2296
Horrible Camping Trip,At least theyve got some chocolate HobnobsCalvin tell your dad that any judge would take this trip as grounds for divorce— Mom Calvin and HobbesSimply put several members of the cast go on a camping trip and disaster ensuesThis plot is sometimes used even in situations where the characters do not live anywhere near the wilderness nor seem the type who would even go on camping trips or have any experience doing so In fact you can guarantee that out of a whole group only one person will even think the trip is a good idea usually Dad if its a family Sitcom or the guy who remembers doing it as a kid and will always view the experience through a Nostalgia Filter The Bratty Teenage Daughter on the other hand will not be shy about acting like a City Mouse Another variant is the father and its nearly always the father coming up with the whole thing as a way to have a cheap vacation either because they cant afford better or because he cant be persuaded to unchain his walletnote As anyone whos ever done this can tell you a motel room and a pitch at a campsite are actually quite similar in price and exceedingly cheap examples of either should be regarded with some caution A father especially a macho one to a nerdy son might also take his son on one of these out of a desire for bondingTypical disasters include being SnowedIn dealing with neverending rain struggling with a HardtoLight Fire running out of food suffering from Cabin Fever poison ivy or getting attacked by an incredibly fakelooking bear Or Bigfoot Or every animal It would seem much safer to go to a resort lodge to avoid such things but that will usually be shot down due to budget or because its not traditional enough Its much cheaper to use an old wood cabin set or dark set obscured by bushes where the camera never moves away from a campfire An even cheaper device is characters going ice fishing sometimes in said cabinOccasionally the excuse given is the trip is part of a company retreat in which case its the PointyHaired Boss whos the only one who thinks its a good idea,2056
Bad People Abuse Animals,The righteous care for the needs of their animals but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel — Proverbs 1210 The Bible New International VersionTheres something about cruelty towards animals that really gets to a lot of people Maybe its the fact that theres so little many especially ones smaller than humans can do to defend themselves Maybe its that fact that they often cant even understand why a human is lashing out at them Maybe its the fact that its often so gratuitous and unnecessary Or maybe its the fact that we instinctively feel protective over all things small and adorable Whatever the reason almost all societies are going to look down on somebody if they hurt an animal for no good reasonAnimals considered to be dangerous such as crocodiles snakes bears sharks and big cats are usually an exception see What Measure Is a NonCute for a possible reason though it may also have a lot to do with the fact that those animals arent as defenseless and therefore are not seen as easy victims Furthermore they may be a threat to people and understandably force them to use violence Even then they are still likely to be seen sympathetically under certain circumstances Pets in particular are seen as defenseless as tame animals tend to trust humans As Real Life shows however there may be exceptions with people neutralising the threat of dangerous animals in order to toy with them In this case they are as defenseless as the harmless animals and the perpetrator is just as bad as the others and even more clearly a Dirty CowardAn almost surefire way to make a character irredeemable is to invoke this trope In addition animal cruelty especially torture and mutilation is often treated as an early warning sign for future violent criminals such as a Serial Killer Sometimes however the whole thing may be played for Black Comedy and Cringe Comedy instead in which case the show may take Refuge in Audacity and the person involved may not exactly be bad so much as hes stupidNote that as a general rule the abuse must be humanonanimal or in Speculative Fiction sapientonnonsapient except for situations involving Furry Confusion The animals must also not be anthropomorphic Being able to use a human language is acceptable but the animals in the work must have roughly the same relationship with humans as they do in real life so far as the humans concerned dont know about their sapienceKick the Dog and If Youre So Evil Eat This Kitten are not always related since any act of gratuitous evil besides hurting animals can be substituted there See also Cruella to Animals and Exotic Entree for more specific variants and Enemy to All Living Things for a more supernatural one Chronic Pet Killer may also overlap if the killing isnt done on accident Black Comedy Animal Cruelty is when this trope is Played for Laughs Animal Lover is the direct inverseWhile exaggerated in fiction psychologists have even observed that animal abuse is a common early warning sign of a Serial Killer As noted on the same sources this is especially true of children living in an abusive environment who may use an animal to reenact violent episodes from their life Given help many of these kids grow up to lead healthy and productive livesSince there is a lot of debate on what does and does not count as animal abuse No Real Life Examples Please As a rule of thumb your example will need to legally qualify as animal abuse in Real Life in order to count Also just like Abusive Parents this trope is not for complaining about characters you dislikeSubTrope to Good Taming Evil Taming Compare Menagerie of Misery in which bad people also own zoos and abuse animalsFor indepth information on the awful subject see the article on That Other Wiki,3732

Combat Pragmatist,Only a heathen would bring a gun to a sword fight And only a moron would bring a sword to a gun fightWill Turner You didnt beat me You ignored the rules of engagement In a fair fight Id kill you Jack Sparrow Thats not much incentive for me to fight fair then is it— Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black PearlSome fights have rules Most dont However a lot of people will still fight as though there are rulesHeh suckersThe Combat Pragmatist is a character who is defined by their willingness to do anything in a fight to winThis typically applies to real fights where theres actually something at stake thats more important than a cash prize a trophy or a title belt and usually not professional fights in a controlled environment where safeguards are in place to prevent one side from suffering too much damage and where one can be disqualified for not abiding by the rules In such settings the Combat Pragmatist is an unsympathetic character usually the main antagonist who shows through their ruthlessness that they honor nothing — not their opponents not the sport and its customs not the tournaments sacred history — but winning and tends to believe that theres no such thing as a dirty fight if your goal is to surviveThese characters are characterized by an extensive knowledge of tactics others may consider dirty fighting or just by a willingness to use those tactics to achieve their goal often against more honorable opponents ie Genre Blind ones They are likely to think of any adherence to rules or sporting combat as Honor Before ReasonThey do not suffer from a Complexity Addiction are never afraid to use a Mundane Solution nor do they need it to be pointed out to them never assume that the other person will fight honorably have no interest in handicapping themselves dont care if their opponent is a worthy one and will not hesitate to Kick Them While They Are Down They almost always have their weapon of choice either on them or near them at all times and possibly a spare or two knives and daggers are an especially popular choice for such characters due to their light weight and ease of concealment So do guns especially if everybody else is adverse at carrying firearms for whatever reason But if caught without their weapons theyre willing to use absolutely anything as a weapon and only resort to Good Old Fisticuffs if theres no weapon nearbyThey will not hesitate to use a Dangerous Forbidden Technique They have no compunction about hurting a child Or about attacking someone from behind Or throwing sand in their eyes Or pulling down their pants or flipping up their skirts if dealing with women or a kiltwearing man Or the Hey You Haymaker Or biting them Or using Weighted Gloves Or a Groin Attack Or hitting the other guy upside the head with the hilt of their sword Or pretending to surrender Or well you get the idea However there can be different levels of this Even those who dont believe in fighting fair may still have lines they wont cross such as refusing to kill or not hurting anyone whos not already part of the fightOften overlaps with the NoNonsense Nemesis Anti Heroes and especially Ninja They almost never allow honor or sentiment to cloud their judgement will usually take measures to avoid setbacks or betrayal Sometimes Weak but Skilled or Too Clever by Half though the truly pragmatic former will constantly seek to increase their power level and hence advantage over their enemies It can look like Confusion Fu in practice — but it almost always isnt If The Unfettered fights then theyll be one of these In a video game dont expect them to be above using a Cheese Strategy to winThis can be an Establishing Character Moment It can also be divisive both among the audience and InUniverse due to Moral Myopia — the hero is a resourceful badass while the villain is just a dirty cheater This can lead to instances of BlackandGray Morality showing that the hero and the villain arent so different and the difference between someone being a terrorist or a freedom fighter For heroes its possible for these tactics if extreme enough to lead to What the Hell Hero moments or claims of If You Kill Him You Will Be Just Like Him sometimes resulting in responses of I Did What I Had to Do and in extreme cases can be a metaphor for Slowly Slipping Into Evil that represents the start or conclusion of a FaceHeel Turn Escalation can also be an issue as someone who previously fought honourably may now decide that The Gloves Come Off and demonstrate a willingness to go to much much darker depthsVillains can also be pragmatic though it usually takes on a different form Villains being normal Combat Pragmatists is usually averted or at least not played out completely straight as it can possibly even lead to them being victorious If they are it means they avert Bond Villain Stupidity and actually kill the hero instead of having dinner with them Depending on the context using these tactics can be their Kick the Dog moment or even their crossing of the Moral Event HorizonCharacters are often deliberately not put into this trope due to Rule of Cool If everyone took this approach to combat who could key characters would be dead or defeated too soon and the story would be over a little too quickly Plus its often just way cooler to show off more complicated tactics than simple ones Additionally Moral Guardians and Media Watchdogs sometimes make having this type of character difficult by ensuring that they cant do certain actions On the other hand when drawnout straight fights are impractical excitement can be created by Genre Shift away from pure action to espionage planning intrigue and the thrill of the hunt with clever heroes and villains alike who avoid the Idiot Ball and unnecessary flash and any open violence being quick and decisive However this can come as Cheating in a fight with no rules is not cheating and If you want to defeat the bad guys you dont have to fight fair with them War Crime Subverts Heroism is a related tropeOn occasion a Badass Teacher or Cynical Mentor will be this when teaching their mentee to fight particularly if the mentee is inexperienced is being trained to literally fight for their life or at some other extreme disadvantage to honorable opponents This is more common in literature where fighting is more realistic so its harder to downplay a blow received and its difficult to describe an honorable fight where a disadvantaged opponent would realistically winCan occur with Limited Window of Vulnerability when the pragmatic solution is to kill someone or something very quickly while theyre vulnerable This is very often the case for the more smarter and opportunistic Fragile Speedsters After all what they may lack in force and raw power they can certainly improvise and do it swiftly to outwit the opposition at leastCuriously enough those of GreyandGray Morality would be the best example here These characters shrewdly see the good and bad in pretty much every concept On one hand maybe sending that criminal to prison is the right thing but will they really repent their crimes This kind of contemplation is very common for charactersthemes like these that to say good is right and evil is wrong entirely is not an absoluteNeedless to say when the author decides that being a right bastard in battle is not a applicable solution to the problems of the plot some hoops may need to be leaped through,7416
Crosses the Line Twice                    aka Cross The Line Twice,Thats wrong Thats brilliant note Shouldnt the planes be white though White moves firstI may disapprove of a movie for going too far and yet have a sneaky regard for a movie that goes much much farther than merely too far— Roger Ebert on Shoot Em UpPain is funny Therefore more pain must be even funnierThus goes the logic in a lot of comedy shows and a few adult cartoons Sadly thats not the case The line separating The Three Stoogesstyle painful fun from outright villainous squicky sadism varies from person to person but is definitely there crossing it makes one fans Nyuk nyuk another fans Guilty PleasuresHowever if a show goes far enough with its violence it may end up crossing the line not once but twice as it goes around the planet and crosses it again This second crossing takes the violence from sick back to funny in its ridiculous extremes Similar to So Bad Its Good but done quite intentionallyThis isnt as easy as it sounds Shows attempting to be Darker and Edgier with their humor this way straddle the line between sadism and comedy and its easy to make a mistake and fall on the wrong side of the SS Tightrope Rather than cross the line a second time the show makes a Wrong Turn at Albuquerque and breaks the audiences Willing Suspension of Disbelief Some people just dont have a second line to cross in their minds and will dislike any turn into sadism or vulgarityThis can also apply to things other than violence for funnys sake any time a little exaggeration would provoke a negative reaction but exaggeration is fine thats crossing the line twice Take action scenes for example some shows try to keep action scenes realistic in order to seem believable while others go so far over the top that it breaks the audiences Willing Suspension of Disbelief Still others take the overthetop so over the top that what was before unbelievable garbage is now heartwrenching adrenalinerushing undiluted AWESOME Of course this form of the trope is just as subjective as the last so be careful what you put down as an exampleSee also Black Comedy Bloody Hilarious Refuge in Audacity Vulgar Humor If this happens completely by accident thats Springtime for Hitler Part of the Sliding Scale of Comedy and Horror When this trope isnt taken to extreme overthetop levels its mere Comedic Sociopathy When it succeeds in being offensive but not so much at comedy its Dude Not FunnyThe Hilariously Abusive Childhood depends on this trope piling misfortune on misfortune until it becomes so ridiculous its funny For instance the Boarding School of Horrors in Bleak Expectations would be abusive if the staff beat the students and deprived them of food That they use the boys as ammo for artillery practice and make them play a game where the smallest boy is chosen as the ball kicked and punched across the field and finally has his head shoved in a bucket of manure to score a goal is just sillyThis is also the way the Heroic Comedic Sociopath holds the audiences hearts This character does evil in such an overthetop outrageous fashion that the audience stops feeling any moral qualms because its so overthetop and out of line that it becomes hilarious insteadCompare Actually Pretty Funny when even the target of the joke concedes the humor of the situation,3263

Surprisingly Realistic Outcome,Float like a butterfly sting like a bee Try to dodge bullets and youll end up like meIt doesnt seem possible but I guess TV has betrayed me— Bart Simpson The Simpsons Simpsons Roasting on an Open FireSay youre watching your favorite action movie Bob is in a car chase and the bad guys are right behind him He sees a sharp turn up ahead next to a brick wall Thinking ahead Bob decides to drift at the last second so he can cause his pursuers to crash and escape However Bob is not an experienced drifter so instead of drifting the car flips barrel rolls and smashes into the wall letting the bad guys catch up with himThis is what is probably going through your mind Huh Wait What Did that just happen I mean that is how it would happen in Real Life but A Surprisingly Realistic Outcome happens when a work subverts narrative conventions by deriving an outcome from realistic principles temporarily removing otherwise fictional logic We can often anticipate results based on the storys narrative pattern this trope subverts those expectations by momentarily employing more realism than its normThis trope isnt merely a Plot Twist To minimize stress on editors make sure your example is Surprising Realistic and an Outcome Surprising A moment needs to be objectively surprising to qualify meaning a Surprisingly Realistic Outcome requires an Expected Unrealistic Outcome for its genre We expect unexpected events in fiction as stories would be boring if everything always happened according to plan Unlike a regular Plot Twist a surprisingly realistic moment deliberately guides audience expectations in one direction only to suddenly avert the Artistic License or Rule of X necessary for that outcome In doing so it highlights how unrealistic it was for the viewer to expect that in the first place Also character reactions cannot qualify under this trope as real peoples emotional and psychological responses to a situation vary wildly We cant say any response is necessarily unrealistic in fictional scenarios and not even the characters author can know such things Realistic The outcome must be possible in Real Life An example with even the slightest bit of Applied Phlebotinum isnt this trope Real people cant actualize Functional Magic Fantasy Science Fiction and the like so its impossible to tell how things would really turn out when such elements exist Powers possessing a Logical Weakness or a subversion of Required Secondary Powers should go under those respective tropes Outcome This conventiondefying realistic consequence has to actually happen Simply pointing out how something wouldnt work the way it does in fiction doesnt count Also to curb potential misuse check if listing your example as a subversion of a specific trope would work better If it does theres no point in putting it here Also it should happen during the story as a consequence of an action or event Innate traits or features of a character or setting that have been there since before the story dont count even if theres a logical reason for themA Surprisingly Realistic Outcome differs from Deconstruction in several ways Expectations Once weve identified a work as a deconstruction we should be able to anticipate how it handles certain tropes differing from how this trope must be surprising While a deconstruction will sometimes lead with a Surprisingly Realistic Outcome the consequences down the line wont surprise us anymore Timing Because a Surprisingly Realistic Outcome is a subversion and is often jarring its supposed to be a momentary trope Deconstructions typically weave themselves into the fabric of a story creating something lasting for at least a significant portion of the work Realism A Surprisingly Realistic Outcome subverts expectations by refusing to have things work how one would expect from fiction meaning it excludes all Applied Phlebotinum A deconstruction discusses or plays with assumptions underpinning a trope or theme Deconstructions dont necessarily involve objective realism as they can include examining a Logical Weakness or a subversion of Required Secondary Powers While we can deconstruct the workings of Applied Phlebotinum we cant make it realisticVideo game examples overlap with Unexpectedly Realistic Gameplay AntiClimax might run in parallel but doesnt require realism Fridge Logic is when the realistic outcome exists only in the audiences mind Extraordinary World Ordinary Problems is about mundane problems still existing in fictional settings Puff of Logic is when an unrealistic outcome abruptly becomes realistic after someone mentions the unrealism An Unbuilt Trope deals with situations where the Expected Unrealistic Outcome didnt exist at the time and veers more towards this tropePlease do not add any reallife examples as this trope is about differing expectations between reality and fiction For cases of fiction making you expect the wrong things in real life see

Misspelling Out Loud,All I need to know how to spell is Kill KYYYL— Houk mook Star Wars The Old RepublicSomeone has to spell a word out loud for the sake of clarity for emphasis for Censorship by Spelling or because theyre in a Spelling Bee and they make an elementary spelling mistake or even spell a different word entirely The reason can range from being illiterate to dyslexic all the way to being able to read just fine but having never seen the word in written form If its the latter this usually reflects negatively on the characters attentiveness and if its either of the former it reflects negatively on the characters intelligence In the case of spelling bees though sometimes the child actually knows the correct spelling and would not normally spell such a word incorrectly but is intentionally losing the bee because theyre sick of their parents putting such immense undue pressure on them at their ageIn English these common spelling mistakes include inserting a spurious silent E changing a hard S to a Z or almost any of the mangled spellings whose deliberate use is described under Xtreme Kool Letterz,1097
Subverted Trope,In other words the story does not trick the player it is the player that tricks himself— Hideo KojimaBasically this is playing bait and switch with a trope A work makes you think a trope is going to happen but it doesntBut how could people know a trope is going to happen Well tropes live in the minds of the audience As such sufficiently Trope Savvy audience members can predict a familiar trope coming based on the hints dropped by the writer So when the writer decides to build on this expectation only to reveal that the expected trope was a Red Herring while an entirely different situation results you have a Subverted TropePhrased another way the work is ultimately revealed not to be using the trope at all but in the meantime was played up to look like it wasThis is one method of leveraging a trope to give a story texture It certainly isnt the only wayA subversion has two mandatory segments First the expectation is set up that something we have seen plenty of times before is coming then that setup is paid off with something else entirely The setup is a trope the something else is the subversionTo put this another way a trope of the form X are often Y is not subverted by every X you can think of that isnt Y If someone is murdered and theres a butler around but he didnt do it thats not automatically a subversion of The Butler Did It thats an aversion But if the writer makes it look like a typical example of The Butler Did It then reveals he didnt thats a subversionA full comparison could go something like this A car chase is in progress at reckless speeds The camera cuts to some workers carrying a Sheet of Glass then cuts back to the panicked driver headed towards the workers It seems pretty obvious that the driver is going to smash the glass sheet into a million fragments or is it If the car drives through the pane of glass its played straight If the car drives through the pane of glass and the workers are heard complaining about why cars that are being chased can avoid nearly everything but a pane of glass its lampshaded If the car drives through the pane of glass and the driver stops to explain the reason why he crashed into it its justified If the car misses the pane of glass its subverted If something else causes the glass to be broken before the car can even make it to where the glass pane broke its also subverted If the car misses the pane of glass but a second car breaks it instead its a double subversion If the pane of glass is broken before being hit by the car which then drives through a different pane of glass carried by a second pair of workers its also double subverted Another double subversion is if the car hits the glass and knocks it out of the workers hands without damage to the glass or car and the glass crumbles after it gets picked back up If the car comes down the road in a series of wide turns and it isnt clear if the car will hit the pane of glass if it ever makes it there its zigzagged If the car disappears from view and isnt seen again until after the sound of glass breaking its implied If the car stops before hitting the pane of glass and then takes a different route its defied If the car drives into the pane of glass and not only the glass shatters but also the car as well as the workers its exaggerated If the car is not doomed to hit the pane of glass but one of the workers sees the car coming and stops in the street such that the car drives into the pane of glass its invoked If the car drives through the glass and views are shown of damage sustained by the car either complicating the driveability of the vehicle andor making the car more identifiable to the chasers or the workers point out the direction of the car to the chasers as they drive by its deconstructed However if the chasing cars get flat tires driving over the glass shards strewn across the street or if the drivers stop to see to the workers injuries from the broken glass its reconstructed If the car hits the pane of glass and the chasing cars regain their lost trail from the scattered pieces of glass its exploited and also Played for Drama If the car drives into the pane of glass and the result is that the glass merely has a carshaped hole in it thats downplayed and also Played for Laughs but thats another matter Its also Impact Silhouette played straight If the car drives into the pane of glass but the glass is only slightly chipped then thats also downplayed and also played straight However if the car drives into the pane of glass and the result is that the glass merely has a carshaped hole in it but the pane of glass collapsed on itself its either played straight or a double subversion And also breaking a downplay If the car drives through the pane of glass backwards or in any other weird way that a car should not be driving in its parodied If the car drives through the pane of glass but its the car that shatters instead of the glass its inverted and a very shoddilybuilt car at that If the car hits the pane of glass and drives through unharmed because the car company paid to have their car in the film and wouldnt allow its use unless it was show undamaged its enforced If the workers are talking about the possibility of a car driving through the glass before the car chase reaches them its discussed If the cars occupants mention the number of car chases that lead to a pane of glass being carried across a street its conversed If the car drives into the pane of glass but the glass endures and car bounces back it is backfired If there is no pane of glass despite road signs saying glass factory or no car chase despite hearing engines roaring from the distance while the workers transport the glass through the road its avertedAdditionally note that a trope can be handled in different ways in different parts of a work its not uncommon for longrunning serial works to sometimes play with or subvert tropes that they initially played straightBear in mind that just as Tropes Are Tools subversions are not automatically good witty clever or originalPlaying with a Trope compares this with many other ways that a trope can be used,6118
Tree Buchet,Tree 1 Dwarf 0In animation seeing a tall skinny tree anywhere is a sure sign that someone is about to go flyingIn the world of cartoons any sufficiently tall flexible tree can be transformed into a trebuchet The formula is generally as follows Have the villain chase the hero through a forest tree farm or any other sufficiently wooded area In an attempt to escape the villain have the hero run up the tallest skinniest tree available Have the villain chase the hero up the tree The fairly fragile tree will begin to bend beneath the weight of both people trapped within it frequently doubling over The hero must now jump out of the tree We have a few seconds to register the look of terror on the villains face before the tree freed of the excess weight snaps back up Thwwwwpp The villain goes flyingA frequent variation is for a character to use a tree snare  a tree purposefully bent low with a trap tied to one end Usually the hunter will find himself either riding the tree out of town or thrown back and forth after they get caught in their own trapAnother variation is the villain choosing to catapult himself with a tree either to reach something higher or to jump over a wall The effect varies from catapulting directly into the ground to missing the target by one inchYet another variation is the hero using it to launch himself This works unless its too early in the story for successTree Buchets are named after trebuchets pronounced trehbyushay Note that the classic Tree Buchet is not an actual trebuchet trebuchets work using a lever with heavy counterweights Tree Buchets work because trees are apparently perfectly elastic The tree snare variant does work but only with very young softwood saplings Mature trees might still be skinny but just arent this flexible Most likely to appear in worlds where Bamboo Technology is prevalent Can be a result of Watch Out for That TreeCompare Catapult to Glory where this is done with an actual catapult Note that to some extent this has been deemed Busted by MythBusters,2028

Shown Their Work,A writer cannot do too much researchthough sometimes it is a mistake to try and cram too much of what you learned into your novel Research gives you a foundation to build on but in the end its only the story that matters— George R R MartinAlthough many talents in fictional media show they didnt do their research some actually did In fact sometimes they learned so much and worked so hard to learn it that it would hardly seem fitting to just not show it off They may also very well have Cast the ExpertThe Shown Their Work trope comes in when the creators tweak their stories to show the viewerreader what they have learned The trick is to do it so this advances the story instead of stopping it cold When its done right in a wellmade work awards for its educational value can be just as nifty as the artistic awardsThis often happens in older harder SciFi books wherein the authors try to keep the science as consistent as possible with currentlyunderstood scientific theories Of course since Science Marches On this may date the book badlyMore often than not the stuff authors look into wont be things with which the average Joe is familiar If its something particularly unrealistic the audience might just write it off as typical fiction even though it actually is a thingWhen an author claims to have done the research but definitely hasnt thats Falsely Advertised Accuracy Any examples of that list are there here the claim is proven correctNote that this does not include explicitly educational productions since they obviously have to be both accurate and explanatory to be effectiveCompare Narrative Filigree which is also about going above and beyond in regards to production quality Lampshaded the Obscure Reference Surprisingly Realistic Outcome Write What You Know when a work showcases a lot of indepth information as a result of the creator having prior knowledge of the subject as opposed to needing to research it and any Artistic LicenseNote that this is only as good as the writer makes it Just because you did the research doesnt mean it adds to the story especially if the research is shoehorned in just to show off Likewise sometimes its better just to make things up Remember that one of the reasons why the Sci Fi Ghetto existed in the first place was because authors of old and some even now overused this trope creating walls of Info Dump instead of stories If people wanted to have a lecture in science they would grab scientific essays in the first placeAlso keep in mind that referencing things doesnt by default make a work smarter than one that doesntTry to keep this page from becoming Gushing About Shows You LikeTheres a LiveJournal community for authors conducting such research on nontrivial topicsIf the work is simply using real locations as backgrounds consider using RealPlace Background If the work contains both real backgrounds and other research then by all means include it here as well If the work relies on the help of someone with knowledge about a certain element to correctly portray it see Technical Advisor,3059

Adults Are Useless,Grownups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them— Antoine de SaintExupéry The Little PrinceIn some shows that revolve around teenagers preteens or younger children adults cant do anything right — if they appear onscreen at all Teachers tend to be annoying sticksinthemud who do nothing but spoil peoples fun Parents are clueless no longer care or are either over or underprotective And any other designated authority figures the kid might come across Forget itUsually this is just plot necessity especially on comedy shows After all a HighSchool Hustler could hardly get anything done if the teachers kept their eyes open and if the parents were vigilant being told that You Are Grounded would wreck the plotBut on a handful of drama shows theres a real venom to it Radio Free Roscoe is about a group of heroic teens who defy a tyrannical school administration On a smaller scale Degrassi The Next Generation has episodes where it is implied that stealing school property is no big deal but its disgraceful to inform on the thiefThis can also occur in shows where you Cant Get Away with Nuthin — kids who break school rules somehow always get caught but due to bad luck not because a teacher was alertThis is also common when adults are told something is happening but simply dont believe it resulting in a Cassandra TruthOne of the reasons this trope occurs is the Anthropic Principle If the adults could fix everything Then the story wouldnt be very interesting Though there is a lot more to this trope than a simple Adults must be useless  writers can easily use this trope in many waysThis trope often gives the impression that only teens or younger kids are capable of saving the world and stuff The problem with this is that it implies that theres no point in telling adults about your problems because theyd either disbelieve you or be too useless to helpHowever this trope can occasionally be used in a more mature fashion to demonstrate a moral about growing up and realizing that adults — even your own parents — are not allpowerful This is especially common in military or warthemed shows and literature where the point is that adults are ultimately unable to protect the younger generation This version is unfortunately often Truth in Television Another interpretation of this is merely that the adults who can help wont because the dilemmas solution at least the obvious and often more exciting one would pretty much wind up breaking several laws and safety codes This can be especially true in a lot of shows involving the police or military the ones who strictly adhere to code are always shown incompetent whereas the ones who break code are the competent ones It may be a good way to teach that you cant solve all your problems by just asking the grownups to helpAnother seldomused aspect of this trope sort of plays off the above In this version its not that Adults are useless quite the opposite The problem is that the protagonists — because of youthful embarrassment a need to prove themselves or simple ego — cant ask for help or accept it when its given The message here is that asking for help is a good thing one cant do everything alone and not bothering to trust people with more skillexperience ultimately causes more trouble than its worth This version is also Truth in TelevisionAnother more mature variant of the trope and one that is also unfortunately Truth in Television is that the adults are abusive and other adults around cover for the abuse or justify it andor the abusers While in many settings theres someone the child could eventually find for help in some small towns in The 50s before the internet fundamentalist religious societies there isnt or the children dont knowcant find the actually supportive adults andor cant identify their treatment as abuseSometimes it may even be a simple case of Poor Communication Kills  sometimes the adults seem worthless because they arent seeing it from the characters point of view Or a combination of the above where the kids simply dont tell the adults so they dont knowParental Obliviousness and Police Are Useless are subtropes An Obstructive Bureaucrat may show up but its not something the younger age group encounters often The logical extreme of this trope is when There Are No AdultsSee also Teenage Wasteland Competence Zone Parent ex Machina Best Years of Your Life Lazy Husband Babysitter from Hell and AnticsEnabling Wife Likely occurs with Kid Hero especially in Role Playing Games where the main characters are almost always under 20 often around 1418 Normally there are one or two older characters to act as a sage or adviserNot to Be Confused with Humans Are Morons which deals with everybody being like this,4791

Red Oni Blue Oni,Detective Somerset We must divorce ourselves from emotion here No matter how hard it is we have to remain focused on the details— Detective Mills Hey man I feed off my emotions okay Hows that Mills promptly gets into a fight with a reporter snooping around the crime scene Hey man Im sorry They justthey piss me off okay Detective Somerset sarcastically Its okay Its impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions— Se7enThis trope is about two individuals or occasionally factions or civilizations that are significantly linked together somehow such as through a rivalry friendship being siblings coworkers competitors etc that have differing personalities and with it often different approaches to the world in general especially whatever they might be competing inforover This of course gives them something to butt heads about since their manner of acting may rub each other the wrong way and each is sure that their way of doing things is rightBy the way dont get too stuck on the colors in the title The title refers to a Japanese tradition that gets elaborated a bit later in the article but it doesnt mean that a character has to dress in or be associated with a particular color in order to fit the roleTheir personalities usually run roughly along the following lines The Red Oni is associated with passion wildness and defiance A Red Oni character is often more brawny than brainy extroverted enthusiastic determined and filled with a zest for life They are also much more likely to break conventions and rules than their counterpart Often an Idiot Hero or in more mature pieces a Boisterous Bruiser If a Red Oni is indeed noticeably intelligent they will still be much more wild and impetuous than the Blue Oni andor with less sophisticated thoughts feelings or goals Generally speaking theyre more peopleoriented than goaloriented although both Onis can be either They may or may not shrug off criticism about themselves or their aims and goals but say or do something nasty to their closest friends and youve just guaranteed yourself a world of pain When a goaloriented villain the Red Oni will often be AxCrazy and psychotically willing to sacrifice any innocent lives to achieve their goals A more Affably Evil Red Oni tends to be a Blood Knight In terms of character alignment the Red Oni tends towards the Chaotic alignments though this isnt always the case Freudian and Power Trios The Id may be The McCoy though not guaranteed FourPhilosophy Ensemble Optimist or Apathetic FourTemperament Ensemble Sanguine or Choleric FiveMan Band The LeaderThe Hero The Lancer or The Big Guy Dere types Deredere Tsundere Yandere The Blue Oni is associated with serenity control and observing authority A Blue Oni is more intellectual proud traditional introverted and cultured sometimes more spiritual although thats not guaranteed if a Blue Oni is indeed physically strong they tend to be Genius Bruisers with the calm collected intelligence of a typical Blue Oni character combined with the physical prowess of a typical Red Oni character Blue Oni personalities are often respected by others but also likely to puzzle confound or even intimidate their peers because they are difficult to read and have a mysterious quality to them Personality subtypes include The Stoic The Quiet One Aloof Big Brother and Deadpan Snarker Its worth noting that while blue types appear tremendously calm and composed sometimes this is just the surface and scratching that façade may show that they are if anything wound far too tight beneath their calm and unemotional appearance Villainous Blue Oni tend to be willing to sacrifice anything and often anyone for their goals mostly only when their villainous goals are laden with true purpose see Knight Templar and WellIntentioned Extremist Being more calculating conniving and thorough and if The Mole comes into play Blue Oni tend to be more successful villains longterm than Red Oni In terms of character alignment the Blue Oni tends towards the Lawful alignments though this isnt always the case Freudian and Power Trios The Superego or The Ego may be The Spock or The Kirk though not guaranteed FourPhilosophy Ensemble Cynic or Realist FourTemperament Ensemble Melancholic or Phlegmatic FiveMan Band The Leader The Lancer If the leaderhero is a Red Oni The Heart or The Smart Guy Dere types Kuudere Dandere HimedereWhile many expressions of this trope play it straight it is also not uncommon for the Blue Oni and Red Oni to mix traits The Red Oni while usually the more passionate and emotiondriven may be the more easygoing and flexible of the two Their more simplistic worldview may make them at least partially immune to angst and Wangst Conversely the Blue Oni while usually stoic and thoughtful may hide a volatile angsty nature that erupts when pushed too far In such instances the two may switch roles with the Red Oni becoming the reassuring composed partner and the Blue Oni becoming a Whirling Dervish of Rage Compare pairings such as Ken and Ryu with Ken being the red oni  cocky arrogant but decidedly easygoing  and Ryu the blue  stoic disciplined but brimming with internal conflictIf Elemental Powers are present you can usually expect the red oni to use Playing with Fire or something of a similarly flashy nature while the blue oni will prefer Making a Splash or possibly be An Ice Person and an Elemental Rivalry is bornThere are a lot of ways to play their interactions so sometimes the two are both leads on an equal standing sometimes the blue is more of The Smart Guy or The Lancer to the reds Hot Blooded The Leader or The Big Guy The relationship can also vary wildly as they are just as likely to be close friends as they are to be bitter rivals or enemies One thing that is sure is that regardless of how big a cast is when these two are in it they will be magnetically drawn to each otherNote that many times this will be a relative not an absolute distinction the Red Oni need not be The Fool and the Blue Oni need not be a Straw VulcanThe name comes from traditional Japanese folklore where Oni think trollogre usually came in two flavors Red and Blue Over time its gotten popular to ascribe different qualities and personalities to the two colors Think the highstrung Type A personality and the easygoing Type B personality See also the Marid and Ifrits over at Our Genies Are DifferentIn a show where its relevant differences in fighting style may be something like Technician Versus Performer For example a red may rush headlong into combat without focus or a plan relying on surprise or intimidation It may be that their strategy is to close the fight quickly before their opponent can think or adapt Its also possible that theyre going to tank their opponents defenses in order to focus on beating them down The blue may use cunning traps stealth and strategies or tend to win in elegant SingleStroke Battle fashion or rely on hitting a target with magical powers or projectiles from a distance instead of running up to their opponent and punching them in the face Force and Finesse is a variation where red tends to rely on raw power while blue uses precision strikes Analysis page has more examples of possible redblue dynamicsMalemale oni pairs in Japaneselanguage works usually have an Expository Pronoun contrast most

becomes the EgoThe Kirk or a Blue Oni is the Ego as well whos either torn between the two or not involved Thats the basic formula but not always Sometimes as the plot progresses someone new is added and as they become the trio this newcomer might be even more emotional than the Red Oni or is even more calm and calculating than the Blue Oni And whoever keeps the trio together is the egoKeep in mind that this trope can apply to anyone and to any pairs of people They do not have to literally wear red and blue for this trope to work and sometimes they can even wear opposite colors that contrast their roles as a red or blue Oni They also do not have to be of the same gender either as this trope can also apply to two people consisting of a boy and a girlEnergetic and SoftSpoken Duo is a subtrope Compare Outside Man Inside Man Odd Couple Cast Calculus for the evolution of the RedBlue dynamic through various numbers of ensembles Tomboy and Girly Girl Sensitive Guy and Manly Man Order

situation If they are friends it will often be of the Vitriolic Best Buds variety most commonly where one character is completely oblivious to the vitriol,9044

50 years in prison You scumbag How could you The United Supermarket Corporation will starve because of you How do you sleep at night knowing what youve doneThis trope comes in 3 varieties Writers think this isnt that bad but exaggerate for effect So this isnt moral dissonance its just Anvilicious Even if the thing is wrong presenting it as something magnitudes worse usually makes it a Clueless Aesop Cant Get Away with Nuthin uses this a lot Writers use Values Dissonance for dramatic effect This is common in Dystopias police states Historical Fiction and cults But it can also be used to make organizations look like this when they arent like with Dystopias But thanks to Values Dissonance this is often about real cultures from the past or present Writers invoke Values Dissonance for comedic effect A lot of the wellwritten animated shows even dating back decades would do this And Sitcoms will do this as well Arson Murder and Jaywalking or Selective Enforcement is often invoked here This can overlap with the second case when the intent is dark humourSince laws all over the world are rife with Values Dissonance things that are misdemeanors or not even illegal in one country but treated as serious crimes in others can seem like thisCompare with All Crimes Are Equal Even the most minor crimes have extreme punishments And Thats Terrible When a work states that something is bad without saying why Arson Murder and Jaywalking Listing a list of bad things but the last one is the least worst Comical Overreacting A character overreacts to something as a gag Deliberate Values Dissonance A

Faux Affably Evil,Gentleman in body Demon in soulIve adopted a strategy of pleasantness It turns out that one can perpetrate all manner of heinous villainy under a cloak of courtesy and good cheer It seems a man will forfeit all sensible selfinterest if he finds you affable enough to share your company over a flagon of ale— Edmund FoolA villain whose politeness is an act that only serves to enhance their evil Unlike Affably Evil characters whose niceness is genuine despite their malice these villains adopt this pleasant persona and are genuinely mean people They lack a villainous demeanor yet they are truly wholly and unrepentantly evil regardless This kind of villain maintains a friendly courteous mask even as they commit incredibly heinous and horrific acts An Affably Evil villain will treat The Hero like a friend genuinely regret having to fight them and seriously try to win them over A Faux Affably Evil villain will say You know I always look forward to our little meetings while gruesomely torturing them for funAt heart theyre utterly soulless but they mask it with a pleasant polite normal attitude perhaps because they have social standards to live up to or because their pleasantness reflects their sheer enjoyment of evil Maybe its a sign of their severely warped morality or a form of deception or psychological warfare Or maybe theyre just unbearably full of themselves Its anyones guess what this kind of villain will do if they suffer a Villainous Breakdown maybe they will drop all pretenses and find that they are Not So Above It All or maybe they will fall into a state of Dissonant Serenity blabbering offkilter pseudomannerisms as they lapse into their final and greatest puppymurdering spreeDo not confuse with Laughably Evil which is a villain who is funny rather than polite While many Faux Affably Evil villains are also Laughably Evil albeit often with an extremely dark and sadistic sense of humour many other villains are one but not the other Compare and contrast Affably Evil whose niceness is sincere and this Tropes opposite Noble Demon whose demeanor is evil in contrast to their actions For the Evulz is a common motivation though using this trope as a form of Obfuscating Stupidity is also possible Also see its possibly downplayed counterpart Bitch in Sheeps Clothing where a Jerkass at the best of times is hiding behind a Nice Guy facade in order to trick people and doesnt necessarily keep it after showing his real face and Stepford Smiler when a miserable andor mentally unstable person is hiding behind a cheery and sweet facade May also overlap with Bantering Baddie Buddies SoftSpoken Sadist Sugary Malice Wise Old Folk Façade This trope may also be a fan of Confound Them with KindnessContrast with Good is Not Nice which is a good character that just isnt polite Not to be confused with Wicked Cultured where a cultured façade hides unpleasant behavior This trope is also one of the defining traits of a sociopath Due to Draco in Leather Pants they may fall low on the Villains we sympathize with category of the Sliding Scale of Character Appreciation,3092

Earn Your Happy Ending,War Is Hell but with enough determination and a bit of luck youll make it homeI dont think man was meant to attain happiness so easily Happiness is like those palaces in fairy tales whose gates are guarded by dragons we must fight in order to conquer it— Alexandre Dumas The Count of Monte CristoThe basic idea of this trope is that a cast of characters in a story go through a lot more hardship anguish and grief than is really necessary Especially war In the end however you see them get their happilyeverafter Though humans may act bad and the world may seem like its a crapsack that doesnt mean that people cant have a good ending or that things cant be improved with hard work or even The Power of LoveNot to be confused with the Golden Ending in video games where players actually have to earn their happy ending It is possible for both tropes to be in play at the same time however This trope is a specific example of positive LaserGuided KarmaGoing by the memes if a Crapsack World is Grimdark and a world where Rousseau Was Right is Noblebright then a story where this happens might be called A World Half Full or Nobledark — its a world where there is a lot of ugliness and pain but victory is absolutely possible and things can change for the better if you only put the effort inThere may be some overlap with Bittersweet Ending or Surprisingly Happy Ending Compare Earn Your Bad Ending the gameexclusive polar opposite Happily Ever After a SuperTrope to this and Throw the Dog a Bone Contrast Downer Ending,1519
KnowNothing KnowItAll,There are imaginary numbers just not the ones hes thinking ofProfessing themselves to be wise they became fools— Romans 122 The BibleA KnowNothing KnowItAll is a character who insists they know everything is always right that they were the actual original creator of an idea and who generally has an extremely high opinion of themselves and their abilities when nothing could be further from the truthThey are grossly misinformed or just lying about everything they talk about with authority They create nothing new and are Ignorant of Their Own Ignorance Their abilities could best be described as scarce When people call them out on their bullshit or fail to treat them like the geniuses that they know they are it is because they are jealous or too stupid to recognize or understand their genius Such people are in fact the living definition of the word charlatanWhile many characters show signs of being this very few have it as a major facet of their character For example Peter Griffin of Family Guy tends to spew horribly misinformed information but oddly enough sometimes hes right in the rather odd world the series is set inLittle Known Facts are occasionally in the KnowNothings mental arsenal thanks to their obtuse quality but naturally the research wont be Hopefully theyre at least Entertainingly WrongA Real Life engine driving this is the DunningKruger effect where the less competent are paradoxically more likely to consider themselves good at a task because they are also incompetent at assessing their own performance at itCan sometimes intersect with the Jerkass to become an Insufferable Imbecile Compare Too Clever by Half which is when an actually smart person gets overconfident and makes a mistake they thought they were too smart to fall for Small Name Big Ego who both want to be recognized and appreciated but take different paths to it The Alleged Expert and Feigning Intelligence Propense to Delusions of Eloquence though not all of them have them Contrast Insufferable Genius who has the same arrogant attitude but is not incompetent Actually listening to one may result in The Blind Leading the Blind Unintentional cases on serious issues can end up being a Clueless Aesop For a more physical version see Boisterous WeaklingAverted in the case of The Smart Guy because they really do know mostly useful and accurate information,2362

Brutal Honesty,Bringin you the truth no matter how bad it hurts— Three Dog Fallout 3Since everybody in TV land spends all day desperately lying their way out of situations one of the more reliable gags is to create a situation where youd imagine the characters would lie and have them be perfectly honest and straightforward instead Sometimes this can separate a polite person from an impolite person since a brutally honest character may say exactly whats on their mind A hallmark of the Caustic Critic or of a child who doesnt really know how to mince words yetA common twist on this is when the characters are brutally honest but then their honesty is not believed Sometimes this is deliberateAnother common twist is for a character to promise brutal honesty before saying something kindA form of BaitandSwitch Often employed in The Reason You Suck Speech A Blunt Yes typically is an expression of this ArmorPiercing Response may use this If a character is brutally honest about why they dont want to do something theyre Not Even Bothering with an Excuse If the honest character is brutal in general then the Jerkass Has a Point If the character is just brutal regardless of honesty theyre most likely your gardenvariety JerkassAnother variation has Charlie being perfectly sincere and asking Have I ever lied to you Joe will then list every instance where Charlie has lied out of his proverbial butt often citing many examples Little wonder Joe doesnt believe him It seems Charlie is quite an accomplished and imaginative fibber Contrast Honesty Aesop,1540
Encouraged Regifting,Lets face it looking for a gift for someone around the holidays can be hard Even if you have an idea what they want theres always a good chance its sold out This problem is just as difficult in fiction as it is in the real world Many Christmas Specials revolve around trying to get the right gift for someone and the difficulties that entails Often the character finds the perfect gift at the last minute However sometimes they wont and need help from someone else Thats where this trope comes inPicture this Alice has been trying to find a Christmas present for Bob After failing to do so theyre approached by Carol who gives Alice a present She opens it finding its the perfect gift to give to Bob Carol then tells Alice to give the gift to BobA more cynical take on this trope is to have a character give a gift to someone who they know wont enjoy it so that they can use it for themselvesMay result in a They Really Do Love Each Other moment Expect it to show up when there is a Secret Santa Will often occur in the Christmas Episode or the Birthday Episode or any episode that focuses on a holiday where gifts are exchanged,1128

most or all of these OoC moments happen at once you can be sure that the Darkest Hour has arrived leading characters to behave in ways they normally wouldnt because they know they might not have

Trope Namers                    aka Trope Namer,Hello My Name Is Inigo Montoya You Killed My Father Prepare to Die— Inigo Montoya The Princess BrideVarious works are popular or influential when it comes to tropes One measure is how readily we name tropes from these worksThis should not be done lightly and is not a badge of honor Using trope namers lightly or as a badge of honor is TropeNamer Syndrome and leads to confusion renaming and possible deletion of tropesA series usually gets to name a trope if its so widely known for the trope even outside the circle of nerds its basically an icon of it or if it has a term for the situation that is simply Made of Win Or if it happens to be the Trope Maker too Of course since Most Tropers Are Young Nerds we do kinda swing closer to the geek side of things But whaddaya expect This is the Internet after allAlso we at TV Tropes dont want tropes named directly after a trope namer since thetrope namer may always get its own page If they are the Trope Namer the trope name should reflect the difference for example RashomonStyle This is doubly true for characters who must embody the trope so well that one could point to them and say Yeah kinda like him and other tropers will immediately agree without having to consult Google in the process Even so there is no guarantee that even the Trope Namer will always actually be an example of the same tropeKeep in mind however that calling a work the Trope Namer in the initial TLP writeup simply because you took the preliminary title from it especially if you are naming the trope after a character is very presumptuous chances are high that the troper Hive Mind will disagree about whether or not the work is widely known enough to qualify Of course such trope proposals arent technically named yet the title may be subject to change in TLP if someone else comes up with a better title For the purpose of actually finding a better title see Naming a TropeSee also Image Source a listing of

Rays from Heaven,Crepuscular rays are a natural phenomenon in which sunlight appears to burst through clouds in distinct beams◊ They are known by many names often religious ones like the fingers of God Jesus rays or Jacobs Ladder in reference to Jacobs famous dream from Genesis 2812 where he dreamed of a stairway to HeavenThe symbolism is easy to decipher with light used because Light Is Good and light from the sky used because the sky is associated with God as per Heaven AboveIn fiction this shows glory at the Awesome Moment of Crowning beauty in The Promised Land and hope shining during the Darkest Hour This is a very common device in religious artwork since it can show the glory of God or a heaven without having to draw them which might be forbidden impossible or simply hard to pull off It can overlap with Cue the SunNatural Spotlight is a related trope for when the rays highlight an object specifically rather than just being symbolic Subtrope to Empathic Environment Contrast with Gray Rain of Depression and Battle in the Rain Compare Beam of Enlightenment,1058
The 80s, Twas a good decade for pop culturenote The 80s Strike Back by Ryan DunlaveyLegend has it that man once washed his jeans in pure acid— Stephen Colbert The Colbert ReportThe Excessive Eighties a time where you wake up before you gogo when you want to kick off your Sunday shoes as you walk the dinosaur like an Egyptian for 500 miles hear doves cry or feel the Punky power like a virgin while you moonwalk the ThrillerAll the women had big curly hair and wore suits with shoulder pads All the men were preppies who wore pastel suits with narrow ties drove sports cars that Lee Iacocca personally stood behind and traded stocks on Wall Street — after all as Oscar Wilde said nothing says success like excess Unless they happened to be teenagers in which case they were Totally Radical or studied Karate and learnt the meaning of Wax On Wax Off Everyone had huge hairdos enough makeup to sink a ship and power suits with shoulderpads big enough to knock the giant mirrored sunglasses off anyone who walked within a three foot radius of them And those without them had flattops and wore gym clothes and breakdanced on top of cardboard Millennials then known as Echo Boomers and later Generation Y started being born one day to become the young adults of The Turn of the MillenniumComputing technology first became a true cultural force in this decade starting a trend that would keep on snowballing to this very day The Eighties was the decade of cell phones literally sized and shaped like bricks jokes about being unable to program VCRs the death of Betamax and the beginnings of personal computers and gaming consoles beginning to proliferate inside homes perhaps one of the trends from this decade with the largest of cultural implications Cable television also took off big time with MTV TBS HBO and CNN becoming household acronyms though the video itself was all grainy lowdefinition analog However this still looked better than the oftenfuzzy antennabased picture before cableConversely the eighties were also the high water mark of analog culture CD players were a new and exotic technology Heck digital watches were still a relatively new and exotic technology Most people still got their music on LP or cassettes though the CD format would begin to overtake both late into the decade and their news from newspapers delivered in the predawn darkness by FreeRange Children The Commodore 64 was the most common personal computer and an actual PC cost as much as a used car especially if it was equipped with one of those new and exotic five or ten megabyte hard drives The internet was still confined to academia the World Wide Web was still just a pipe dream and what little connectivity existed was through Electronic bulletin board services BBS accessed over analog phone lines using screeching 1200 or 2400 baud modemsIn the US it was also the secondnote The first wave was Astro Boy up through Speed Racer wave of The Japanese Invasion the inklings of which started in 78 with the dub of Battle of the Planets continuing on with Space Battleship Yamato 79 Voltron 84 getting even more hardcore with Robotech in 85 and hitting its apex with the nationwide release of AKIRA 88 Japan additionally managed to break through in the US via the gaming industry with the success of Nintendos Donkey Kong and wider success of the Nintendo Entertainment System leading Japan to become the leading theater of the video game industry in the US following the North American video game industry crash in 1983 Names like Capcom and Konami became major players in the software side of the industry with loads of smash titles that would eventually grow into major franchises and while western developers were still around and making games for Nintendos system it was the Japanese industry that served as the key focal pointWhile other hardware developers would fail to adequately crack Nintendos dominance for most of the decade that all changed in 1987 when a joint venture between NEC and Hudson Soft resulted in the creation of the TurboGrafx16 which became a surprise success in its native Japan and outsold the NES spurring Nintendo into action in creating a competing system to keep their place in the industry intact The following year Sega would introduce its own TurboGrafx rival the Sega Genesis with its 1989 debut in the US managing to both successfully stamp out the TurboGrafxs presence in the west and present the first real challenge to Nintendo as a hardware manufacturer This battle however wouldnt truly take hold until the first years of the next decade in part because it took Nintendo until 1990 in Japan and 1991 in the US to release their own new systemDespite major successes in animation and video games though the Japanese Invasion never quite managed to crack any other fields of popular media in the same way The closest anyone got was in music via both the flashinthepan success of Pink Lady which promptly collapsed after NBC tried to capitalize on them via a disastrous variety show in the spring of 1980 and the longerlasting but ultimately forgotten success of Yellow Magic Orchestra While YMOs legacy would persist through their huge influence on later SynthPop musicians they themselves would be reduced to a cult favorite at best decades later such was the fate of most other Japanese media in large part due to the wider difficulties in attempting to localize them for western audiences compared to video games and animeOn the homefront the 1980s produced a rash of popcultural icons that today are looked upon at worst with Affectionate Parody and at best as the national ideal The conservative political culture of the era meant two rather contradictory things for the production of popculture on the one hand the surge of private enterprise together with new media technologies allowed corporations such as Hasbro an unprecedented ability to build massive franchises around their products typically with a TV show and accompanying toys but on the other hand Moral Guardian complaints would challenge the ethics of making a show that was essentially one large commercial in addition to railing against any work of media that didnt meet their rigid standards The result was the rather spoofworthy And Knowing Is Half the Battle segment common to many mass franchise shows shoving an Anvilicious moral into the action Fortunately these were conveniently located after the actual plot so kids could just turn it off at that point and run down to buy the toys Besides the segments make great joke fodder The prominence of moral guardians during this decade would have considerable ramifications in later decades with mature content being galvanized as the artistic ideal from the 1990s onwardnote the idea already started to take form with the New Hollywood era of 19651983 but solidified in the 90s as a result of the heavy amount of moral guardianship in this decade and companies who appealed to the idea of familyfriendliness most notably Nintendo facing nothing short of ridicule once the conservative culture of the 80s gave way to 90s and 2000s cynicismIronically given its modern reputation as a breeding ground for nostalgia bait the 80s were probably one of the most nostalgiaheavy decades in modern history at least prior to the 2010s Specifically the 80s were extremely kind to The 60s owed to the fact that this marked the point where the Baby Boomer generation who as the name implies consisted of far more people than previous generations reached adulthood and entered areas of the workforce where they could make their longing for their childhoods known aided by the conservative culture of the time that emphasized the supposed glory of the Good Old Days Ronald Reagan for instance ran on the promise to Make America Great Again perfectly encapsulating the public sentiment at the time that society had strayed from a supposed Golden Age from decades prior that historians will be quick to argue didnt actually existnote ironically Bill Clinton would reuse the MAGA slogan during his own presidential campaign in 1992 characterizing the Republican party under George H W Bush as the deviants from a nonexistent golden age it would however return to its original rightwing association with its later coopting by Donald Trump in the 2010s Of course the phenomenon wasnt a rightwingexclusive one even leftwingers held a considerable sense of longing for two decades prior though often for different reasons than the other side of the aisle eg an emphasis on the sociopolitical progress made during that timeNowhere could this 60s nostalgia be more vividly found than in music every veteran 60s act who achieved considerable levels of popularity during that decade were either still going strong in this decade or made a highprofile comeback and production values throughout the decade were rife with 60s callbacks from the heavy emphasis on reverb to the prominence of sax and horn parts now achievable through synthesizers and samplers to the amount of acts who flatout covered old 60s hits Even the Alternative Rock crowd famous for their rejection of mainstream music standards took heavy inspiration from 60s rock albeit with none of the emphasis on synths and horns that mainstream musicians had and with some modifications to get rid of the more poorlyaged aspects no weird stereo mixing here for one This was perhaps most apparent with The Smiths who not only harked back to 60s rock and Baroque Pop in their songs but also featured cropped and coloraltered stills from 60s movies on their album covers in fact the band broke up in part because frontman Morrisseys huge emphasis on 60s throwbacks was getting on everyone elses nervesMost significantly Beatlemania reemerged among the general public following the highprofile assassination of John Lennon and how the consequent shock of it resulted in his surviving bandmates taking the time to tie up loose ends and rebuild burned bridges between each other before it was too late The second wave truly galvanized with a series of highly important business decisions in the waning years of this decade in 1987 the bands entire UK backcatalog was released on CD for the first time consequently cementing those albums as the canon ones much to the confusion of Americans who only had the butchered Capitol Records albums to go off of in 1988 the band was inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame and oversaw the release of Past Masters a twoCD compilation of all their nonalbum singles and in 1989 Paul McCartney finally fully embraced his Beatles heritage and cleared up the last few legal entanglements that had forced Apple Records into dormancy enabling them to resume activity for the first time in ages While the second wave of Beatlemania would continue into following decades hell its still going on to some extent it was most prominent during the 1980s acting as a vivid microcosm of the sheer weight 60s nostalgia held during that time with record companies going back into the vaults to reissue other 60s acts on CD as fast as possible to sell to affluent Baby BoomersPolitically in the first part of the decade Cold War tensions continued to escalate The US did things like invading Grenada and the Strategic Defense Initiative Some accuse this of being an intentional move by the West to render the economically inept Soviet Union infeasible by drawing its resources away from things like infrastructure and feeding its people which market economies could accomplish easily While this is essentially what ended up happening though more complicated than that in real life in Eastern Europe the decades real deathblow to communism was considered to have been all the new media technology the fact that the other possible outcome of such a strategy was global thermonuclear annihilation had a profound impact on Western media tropesThe second part of the decade however couldnt be more different Mikhail Gorbachev spry for a CPSU leader at age 54 this was the only time in the Cold War that the Soviet leader was substantially younger than the American shook up the bythen sclerotic Soviet leadership upon taking power in 1985 Gorbachev restructured the economy perestroika for accelerated development uskoreniye encouraged openness glasnost made tentative moves towards democracy demokratizatsiya and went Karting with Reagan For a hot second in 198889 it seemed like the USSR had reached a final rapprochement with the West And then came its fallWhat is now being called Geek Culturenote Despite Revenge of the Nerds the terms nerd and geek were interchangeable and were chiefly derogatory terms not yet appropriated by the mainstream was at the time just a very loose assortment of nonmainstream fragmented interests and esoterica not yet the monolithic commercial label that has become more corporatized in recent years The conclusion of the original Star Wars trilogy was immediately followed by an explosion of a diverse amount of subgenres cult shows films and other media as different from each other as could be The Star Wars fatigue of the early 80s saw audiences receptive to many new and completely different offerings There was literally something for everyone without one thing trying desperately to be too many things for too many people This decade also saw the official introduction of Doctor Who outside of Britain through its memorable run on public television Comic book fans discovered the diverse world of Independent Comics and Manga as refreshing alternatives to the Big Two Marvel and DC The cartoon shows of this decade were memorable for being well drawn and purely escapist adventure driven and moving away from the Illustrated Radio format of the previous decades Literary science fiction returned to being fun after the overall style of New Wave Science Fiction began to grate on readers and age into irrelevancy with its authors Douglas Adams is one of the most significant authors to launch off the post New Wave era in written science fiction with The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Most obviously dystopian Speculative Fiction particularly set After the End 20 Minutes into the Future enjoyed a surge enter Cyberpunk On the other hand Star Trek became a defiantly optimistic mainstream SciFi mainstay with the feature film series and its return to live action TV with Star Trek The Next GenerationThroughout this era there came new problems like the spread of AIDS which created a public health panic that dealt first a body blow to the gay community with antigay people treating them as modern lepers even though that community took the danger seriously far sooner than others as well as ending the sexual liberation movement of the previous two decades by presenting an STI that couldnt be easily swept away with antibiotics not that antibiotics would last forever given later findings on drugresistant strains of pathogens However the epidemic paradoxically later proved a partial blessing in disguise for gay rights as stricken people like Rock Hudson were shoved out of the closet forcing the public to realize that LGBTI people were all around them much like themselves The Eighties also had the highest murder rate in US history almost twice what it is today As for society as a whole well the left and right werent quite the sodiumandwater combination that dominated the bulk of the 70s though the dominance of conservatism with the Reagan and Thatcher administrations and the continuing fallout from the political blunders of the preceding decade ie Watergate  Vietnam in the US and a severe economic recession in the UK still kept them at odds with one anotherPolitically speaking the decade lasted roughly from January 20 1981 with both Ronald Reagans Presidential inauguration and the end of the Iran Hostage Crisis 20 minutes later to the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9 1989 and the Soviet Union dissolving on December 26 1991 amounting to almost 11 years Sometimes Margaret Thatcher being elected Prime Minister in 1979 is considered the start especially in the UK Culturally the decade lasted roughly from Disco Demolition Night on July 12 1979 the murder of John Lennon on December 8 1980 and the launch of MTV on August 1 1981 to the release of Nirvanas album Nevermind on September 24 1991 and in 1992 with both the rise of Grunge and the emergence of the heroin chic fad Its worth nothing that Steven Spielberg George Lucas andor Tom Cruise were involved in 9 of the 10 highest grossing films of the decadeIts currently the Eighties in much of Fictionland making for an impressive fortyyear nostalgia lag though nostalgia for the early Nineties has been rapidly picking up steam since the beginning of the new Twenties,16686

Have a Gay Old Time,How was this an accident you askTime good friends TimeCock is not dirty all the time thats one of those words thats only partly filthy Cock if youre talking about the animal its perfectly all right They used to read that to us from the Bible in third grade and we would laugh Cock is in the Bible— George CarlinA cross between Accidental Innuendo and Unusual Euphemism as a result of Language Drift — natural changes in the common vocabulary — causes a word or phrase originally intended as wholly innocuous to be potentially taken as startling confusing or just plain funny in a different time or place Usually relates to sexual euphemisms but can also involve other sensitive conceptsEven very slight changes in usage can produce this effect until recently for example a man might speak of his attraction to a young girl and everyone would understand he meant a woman in her 20s Nowadays shed be young or a girl but not both Sometimes the expression still has an innocent meaning that is at least as valid as the naughty onenote For instance young girl generally wont raise eyebrows if the speaker is older and isnt sexualizing her but now there are just too many people with their minds in the gutterCompare with Hilarious in Hindsight of which this is arguably a SubTrope See also Double Entendre or Intentionally Awkward Title for when this trope is invoked entirely intentionally Separated by a Common Language for the spatial analogue and Get Thee to a Nunnery for the reverse processKeep in mind that some of these words actually did have their modern meaning at the time they were used but only within certain sections of the populace The meaning of the word gay for instance began to change as early as 1870 among the criminal classes of New York where it originally meant prostitute yes before The Gay 90s around 1900 the meaning changed to homosexual prostitute and within five years of that to simply homosexual This means that for longer than you might think writers have been employing that word deliberately in order to get crap past the radarSome of these examples result from the euphemism treadmill whereby terms are repeatedly replaced as the previous word falls into such a state of misuse that it cannot be recovered The words idiot moron and imbecile started as clinical terms referring to people with IQs below 75 50 and 25 respectively As these terms fell into common use as insults they were replaced by a kinder and gentler term mentally retarded After decades of that being used as an insult retarded is now considered so offensive that some people want it classified as hate speech The term used to describe people with lifechanging diseases or injuries followed a similar path from crippled to handicapped to disabled to physically challenged when terms like handicapable and differently abled were proposed it came across as too clunky and people generally agreed to stop messing with it As of the mid2010s the treadmill turned again and now disabled is again the preferred termRacist terminology is also a prime example of this The infamous nigger which is so virulent it cannot be even used clinically in many places anymore used to be common language even without racist overtones For example nigger babies used to be a name for a popular candy while Agatha Christie even used the title Ten Little Niggers for her arguably most famous work even back then nigger was considered risky so it was retitled Ten Little Indians for US publication which annoyed another group of people so they eventually settled on And Then There Were None Use of nigger by productions in which it is specifically used as a criticismcondemnation of racism eg All in the Family Blazing Saddles and the Racist Word Association Interview sketch in Saturday Night Lives first season is often misunderstood by modern audiences Nowadays even shows specifically about historic racism will avoid the word due to its baggage and triggering natureWords changed meaning less frequently before the advent of radio and television and when they did change the transformation could be slow as seen with gay above It took over a hundred years for the primary meaning of the verb want to change from lack to desire Television sped things up it took only a few weeks in the 70s for the meaning of boob to change from dummy to breast among the general public Naturally with the advent of the uncensored Internet words can change meaning almost overnight these daysCompare Values Dissonance Harsher in Hindsight and You Keep Using That Word a common cause of this if it happens enough see also Unfortunate Names which sometimes result from this Get Thee to a Nunnery is the inverse for historical slang whose meaning has been forgotten today causing modern audiences to take the word at face value NonNazi Swastika refers to when the trope is applied to Western culture it was seen as a good luck symbol prior to World War IIWhen an instance affected one of two related languages in the past or affected both but with different new meanings the result is a pair of false cognates,5069

Miranda Rights,Donkey What about my Miranda rights Youre supposed to say You have the right to remain silent Nobody said I have the right to remain silent Shrek Donkey you have the right to remain silent What you lack is the capacity Shrek 2In the United States the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution provide valuable rights to those arrested or accused of a crime be you innocent or guilty provided you remember they exist Not easy when your hands are in cuffs and your face is being smashed against the trunk of a police cruiser Until the 1966 Supreme Court decision in Miranda v Arizona from which the term Miranda Rights got their name the police were very unlikely to remind you of those rightsAlthough the exact wording varies from state to state it goes something like this You have the right to remain silent Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning and at trial If you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for youIn some states the following is added Do you understand the rights I have just read to you With these rights in mind do you wish to speak to me Or  do you wish to make a statementIn fiction the Miranda Rightsnote The rights themselves exist independent of the courts decision on Miranda  they are in the Constitution  and the warning is only meant to remind you that they exist although any legal scholar will recognize that say the Fifth Amendment right against selfincrimination falls under the umbrella heading of Miranda Rights while the Third Amendment right to not have to quarter troops in your home does not are frequent victims of Hollywood Law Some common deviations from reality In some movies or series the rights are an inevitable part of every climax In others perps never seem to get their Miranda rights read to them when they are arrested The latter case is actually more realistic police will only read the Miranda Rights to anyone they want to interrogate and theyll usually do so just prior to interrogation rather than as their suspect is being arrested When we see someone Mirandized fictional officers almost always recite the text from memory as if theyve said the words for years by heart In reality while officers certainly do memorize the words over time they are still required to read the rights from a card to avoid mistakes that could get the case thrown out This is because any deviation from the actual rights as printed means the suspect was not properly read their rights In addition suspects are required to sign the card as evidence in case they later deny having been read their rights In fiction the Mirandizing officer is likely to stop when a jaded criminal mastermind mutters Yeah yeah I know my rights In reality they cant because the law requires that an officer inform a suspect of their rights whether they claim to know them or not In fiction the officer might be tempted to interrupt the reading of rights to suggest an obnoxious suspect really should take advantage of their right to remain silent or to modify the if you cannot afford an attorney with sarcastic references to a wealthy suspects obvious ability to afford one In reality as mentioned above any deviation from the words written on the card could be used by a defense attorney to claim that their client was not properly read their rights In fiction sometimes suspects get Off on a Technicality because the arresting officer forgot to read their Miranda Rightsnote which was the case in Miranda v Arizona itself Setting aside how unlikely this would be this tends to be incorrectly treated as automatically resulting in dismissing the case It is rarely brought up that this only affects any statements the suspect made under arrest Any evidence the police had uncovered by unrelated means would still be valid In addition the law presumes that a persons rights were read to them unless clear evidence to the contrary usually in the form of a statement from a reliable eyewitness is presented in writing prior to the trialThe only time in which Miranda can be waived is in cases where public safety is under immediate threat and the officer does not have the time or wherewithal to lecture the perp for 30 seconds The usual example is the hypothetical case where an officer catches a Mad Bomber in a mall and demands to know where the bomber stashed the Time Bomb but exceptions must be approved on an individual basis And even if the suspect is not Mirandized prior to interrogation the evidence gained can still be used by police to justify further action While they may not be allowed to bring up the interrogation in court they can bring up the fact they found a bomb and the bombers fingerprints were all over itEven in cases where an illegal interrogation results in a confession or other evidence discovered as a direct result being ruled inadmissible the so called fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine there are rare occasions where the police can make the inevitable discovery claim essentially stating that they would have discovered the evidence even without the interrogation We would have found evidence of the bomb anyway since it would have blown up and an explosion in a mall would certainly have been investigatedPeople arent always Mirandized upon arrest either sometimes the police will arrest a suspect get him or her into an interrogation room and on camera and then read his or her rights to ensure that the suspects response usually waiving the rights is recorded It used to be accepted procedure in some police departments to interrogate people until they were convinced to confess and then Mirandize them and have them repeat what theyd said for the official record this is now considered to be coercion meaning said statements could not be used against people in courtAnd obviously undercover officers do not need to read rights the police only need to read them to people theyre interrogating who have been arrested if the police are asking questions but the person is free to leave they do not have to be read their rightsIncidentally if you are ever Mirandized even if you are convinced youve done nothing wrong in fact especially if you are convinced youve done nothing wrong the only words out of your mouth should be I want a lawyer and will not consider answering questions until I have one See here for 49 minutes of extremely enlightening and entertaining education on the topicnote  that said also check out this podcast episode starting around 17 minutes in for a breakdown of all the things that video overstates obfuscates or just plain gets wrong Seriously the line of thought which says Only Bad Guys Call Their Lawyers is wrong on more levels than we can count,6728

Last Disrespects,When you gotta go you gotta goOwlson help me up onto his casket so I can dance on it— Flintheart Glomgold DuckTales 2017A funeral is a service that allows a deceaseds family and friends to congregate in one place to celebrate the deceaseds life and pay their respects To do so is considered common courtesy and practice So what do some people do once the family is assembledHow about doing the exact opposite of that by behaving in extremely tactless and inappropriate ways that would have the deceased rolling in their coffins if they knewSometimes this disrespect comes in the form of discussions that are brought up around or even at the time the proceedings begin Perhaps the deceased is an adult involved in one of the ends of an inheritance dispute Maybe the deceased was survived by an illegitimate child or even worse a child that none of the relatives are completely willing to take custody of In any event the attendees of the funeral will be all too eager to talk about those matters rather than to mourn not realizing that talking about them is putting their selfishness and spite out in the openFor a villainous character it can be a form of cowardice because theyre using a corpse to show off It shows them as lacking empathy towards the mourners and they are only doing it because a corpse cant fight back or dispute their claims If the dead person was a villain in life then it shows how much power they had over their victim since the victim only felt safe coming out in public when they were absolutely sure the person was dead and buriedOther times disrespect or lack of concern toward the matter at hand show in their actions After all attending the funeral in improper dress or fooling around with whatever device is in possession instead of paying attention to the pastor or the procession are a few of the best ways to show love and care to the deadAnd thats not touching on those who are much more direct about their scorn toward the deceased If the deceased was a Jerkass or guilty of other negative qualities in life then expect people to open up and gossip about their faults or spit on his coffin now that the deceased is no longer around to complain Sometimes the deceaseds family wont even wait to express their views until the funeral as they will expose them in the obituary as a bad personMany times criminals who are guilty of especially the most heinous of acts will have private funerals if they have one at all that is the funeral is open only to those explicitly invited and often the funeral location will not be announced publicly Other times the obituary will run only after the funeral service and burial This is to keep unwanted intruders from interrupting the service  for instance the embittered victim who was personally or had a close friend or family member particularly harmed by said deceased criminals actions from showing up and  in the process of screaming about how the decedent ruined hisherothers lives — disrupting the service and disrespecting the religious traditions of a funeral After all even the most heinous nowdeceased criminal still likely has family andor friends who wish to at the very least mourn that person in peace and remember himher how they wish to In these cases usually there will be an usher or a police officer standing by the door of the funeral location to stop anyone who does happen to show up uninvitedFuneral scenes like these also come up — particularly in fiction — to show how the people the deceased thought they were close to truly care once they are gone Either they never truly did or they only cared to a shallow degree or the funeral is a way to release pentup frustration hate contempt and so forth toward the decedent emotions that were held in for whatever reason while that person was still living Other times these scenes show what Jerkasses the family and friends can be in general once the deceased is no longer around to remind them when to filter out their open contempt toward the deceased his family andor his life decisionsIn the worst case scenario however the funeral becomes the site of a bloodbath where a rival family embittered enemy or Familial Foe comes armed and takes grieving members of their loved ones with them to the afterlife seeing that the death of just one person does not suffice and the rest of them can join them in death More often than not there are additional bodies to bury in the wake of the massacreThere are sometimes people who dont even have to misbehave If youre attending a funeral for a free meal and other things for your own selfinterest then the dead would have every right to be pissed off at youThe deceased isnt out of danger even after the funeral is over After that bitter peers can pay their disrespects by vandalizing desecrating or even destroying the grave An Excrement Statement is often in play here especially in more lighthearted if disgusting worksThis should not be confused with its Sister Trope The Fun in Funeral though overlap is possible The latter involves wacky situations in a funeral played for humor that occur out of the characters control or because of their idiocy while this trope specifically involves rude uncaring spiteful contemptuous hateful or simply Jerkass behavior and statements about the deceased andor his family made during what is supposed to be a solemn event This can be done for either drama or comedyCompare and contrast Cheerful Funeral where people act in a lighthearted and cheerful manner at a funeral of someone they loved to celebrate their life and the joy they brought when they were aliveThis may also overlap with And There Was Much Rejoicing depending on the context See also Dishonored Dead where the rites themselves are disrespectful or nonexistent and Spiteful Will where the deceased insults the livingContrast with Never Speak Ill of the Dead Compare and contrast Bitter Wedding SpeechAs a Death Trope this trope is Spoilered Rotten by nature and many examples here will spoil a work unless the funeral is part of someones backstory Unmarked spoilers below,6066
What Measure Is a NonHuman,Proposed alternate measure Will It BlendBoy if those employees werent robots I would have looked like some kind of serial killer or something eh— Dr McNinja The Adventures of Dr McNinjaThere is an invisible value placed on the existence of nonhuman characters in fiction compared with the value of the life of a human Killingdestroying one may or may not be the same thing as killing a human The difference between Not Even Human on one end of the scale and Not Quite Human on the other can be a very fine one and where a series chooses to draw that line can vary as wildly as the writers imaginationsIntelligence emotions moral compass and whether the character in question is actually alive in the conventional sense are usually what dictate the morality of the situation But more often than not its also based upon the humanlike physical and psychological traits the character has an issue further explored in this blog post The sliding scale usually goes something like this    Starting with the least likely to be granted rights  Plants protists fungi bacteria and so on and so forth do not count on this scale Except sometimes when tropes like Plant Aliens Planimal Plant People and When Trees Attack come into play Or if the organism is a member of an endangered species Or if youre talking about destroying an entire forest since thats on such a large scale and since there are animals in the forest that could die or get their habitats destroyed Undead beings like skeletons and zombies and victims of certain strains of The Virus do not blip at all in this value despite still being Homo Sapiens Theres hardly any controversy about it either probably because theyre trying to kill you In fact killing one is seen as only helping along a natural process The value of the life of a nonhuman animal in fiction distressingly tends to relate directly to how much humans like said animal Thus dogs are protected by Improbable Infant Survival but snakes spiders and insects are trampled without a second thought Sadly this is Truth in Television To paraphrase an old Denis Leary routine about the Endangered Species Act You know how this is going to end Eventually only the cute and cool animals will get to live Monsters of the Week Giant Monsters and Big CreepyCrawlies are generally treated as huge pests and exterminated as such without much controversy typically in self defense There are some exceptions If you are a monster the more you resemble a more conventional specimen of the creature you are based upon the fewer people you directly harm and most importantly the more personality you have the better your chances are for surviving Some human or other will recognize that you are merely misunderstood and may try to help you Of course if you eat that human youre pretty much boned If the Big Bad is revealed to be nonhuman as a Tomato Surprise or assuming his monstrous true form it usually makes it OK to kill them if it wasnt before Double points if that form is that of a snake or other reptile Clones parallel universe duplicates and other Doppelgangers are often considered expendable even if they absolutely are biologically human and sentient and independent individuals with personalities Restoring an AI from a backup copy is often treated like a Disney Death This is all provided at least one instance of each character survives Sorry but we only need one flannel shirtwearing comic relief guy The thing is it should be more like a twin sibling dying but it tends to be treated more casually instead like Immortal Life Is Cheap This can vary however as while the story can kill them freely without consequence many writers prefer to let their deaths affect the characters with all the pathos such a close death could incur Whether actually treating it like a siblingtwin death a warning about the path they could be taking in the case of an Evil clonealternate self or the consequences of failing with alternate universes or Bad Future selves Vampires although technically among the undead have variable ranges simply because they usually have more personality Most characters can kill them anyway even if theyre Technical Pacifists Certain depictions of Batman and King Graham from Kings Quest have killed off Dracula with favorable karmic results With Graham the Fan Remake takes a different route even when killing anything is anathema to them The idea here as well as with the other undead mentioned above may be Well technically theyre already dead so its okay And anyway Vampires are Always Chaotic Evil Robots and Artificial Intelligence stories examine this quite a lot in their plots for example in the writings of Isaac Asimov The Three Laws obviously put a robots survival below a humans even below human commands Good robots and other Mechanical Lifeforms are considered people most of the time Killing one is generally the karmic equivalent of killing a human the same way — except that it is easier to show them getting hurt think of poor Bishop in Aliens which gets awkward MechaMooks and bad robots almost always have a very low value in this regard even if they demonstrate obvious personalities emotions and humanlike intelligence Regardless robots are the most frequent victims of the How Did You Know That Mook Wasnt Human I Didnt trope Its Just a Machine after all It probably helps that when a robot dies We Can Rebuild Him more easily than bring back a human which is a source of superiority as well human life is more complicated probably because robots are almost always written as not having souls even if they are sentient making them more expendable Supernatural entities vary depending on alignment Typically demons are on the same level as undead And then there is an uncomfortable border line occupied by characters who are human — but since they arent normal they arent considered as such Good Cyborgs if the brain is still intact are almost always considered human except by the persecutors who harass them Bad Cyborgs are treated on the same scale as MechaMooks Other partially disembodied entities whether they once were humans or were made like that run the entire spectrum from being accepted as variant humans to kill them just to end their supposedly nightmarish existence and go drink some Brain Bleach The same can be said for Transhuman characters RubberForehead Aliens rarely have this problem  as their actors are obviously human it is easy to transfer the value this is largely why the trope persists even into the modern CGheavy era Humanoid Animals and Half Human Hybrids tend to get the same protection as a normal human but it depends on how humanlike they are If they take up a form that isnt bipedal rely on their instincts too much or otherwise start toward the Talking Animal side of things they can quickly reach the level of monstersoftheweek As far as other fantastic races it often seems that the morality of killing the race depends on how much they resemble humans either culturally or physically Dwarves elves gnomes and halflings all look relatively human and so killing them is bad but the bestiallooking orcs goblins and trolls are evil and should be killed Other races who obviously are not human but possess cultural traits such as music or clothing styles that the human audience can easily recognize or identify with are also given preferential treatment over whatever evil races existThis is often one of the reasons why Humans Are the Real Monsters It can get especially awkward however when it happens in works of fiction where many of the heroes arent human either leading to uncomfortable Fridge Logic If a human begins to actually value a nonhuman being or species more after their death then thats Death Means HumanityIn general the more thought that is put into the script the more value nonhuman life will have This trope is often used as a metaphor for the Real Life issues of animal and human rights See also That Poor Plant Of the People Zombie Advocate Inhumanable Alien Rights Van Helsing Hate Crimes and Fantastic Racism The flipside of sorts is What Measure Is a NonSuper Related tropes are Uncanny Valley They Would Cut You Up and Emergency Transformation Contrast with Androids Are People TooFor cases in which this treatment applies to characters who are human see What Measure Is a Mook Moral Myopia Immortal Life Is Cheap and A Million Is a StatisticThis also tends to happen in a metafictional way many animated series and video games can get away with horrific violence and onscreen deaths that the censors wouldve put a quick stop to or at least given the work a higher rating had the victims been human Robots the undead and the like can be brutally impaled dismembered and decapitated

Its All Junk,When I was a child I spoke like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a child But when I grew up I put the childish things away— 1 Corinthians 1311 The BibleSome items such as photographs jewellery stuffed toys and family heirlooms are imbued with more worth than money can buy They have sentimental value and are a powerful link with a person or a memory They cant be replaced on an insurance policy if they get stolen because even if the replacement is identical it doesnt have the same value as the original—it lacks the same connotationsAs such these items are protected zealously both in real life and in fiction Sometimes they act as comfort blankets when the protagonist is far from home and missing his mother Sometimes theyre all they have to remind them of a Doomed Hometown Either way the audience is usually informed of these items deep significanceBut occasionally there comes a time when you decide that whatever that trinket represents is no longer important or more drastically you come to realize that the person or memory it binds you to are not people or memories you want to be associated with any more Maybe the boyfriend who gave the heroine her heartshaped pendant has been twotiming her for the past year or an ice skater finally realizes that theyre too badly injured to make it as a champion making their favourite skating boots a painful reminder of their lost dream Either way its time to get rid of the MacGuffinUsually the item is an innocent scapegoat—the pendant itself didnt betray its owner and the ice skates werent driving the car that hit the protagonist Its just that the heroine cant actually get their hands on the person thats caused the problem especially if the change or misfortune is down to nothing more than luck or time Characters who can get their revenge and have no qualms about doing so dont tend to bother with destroying jewelry — they just go and punch the offenders face in Its the gentler less violent characters or those who really have no actual person they can blame who decide Its All Junk and get rid of a fairly innocuous item Their destruction is purely symbolic to show that the character is finishing a chapter of their lives and starting a new oneIt is quite rare for these objects to be sold even if they are actually quite valuable Theyre either destroyed often with fire or discarded if the hero is getting rid of them because they want nothing more to do with what they symbolise or passed on to someone else if the hero is acknowledging that their time in a particular role has passed and wants to hand the item down to someone who can make better use of it By not even claiming the money they would make from a sale the character further acknowledges that they reject their trinket and everything it stands forSometimes its not even a trinket—it can be something as big as a house or even a home town Rarely it might be a pet though this has to be dealt with sensitively A potentially callous example would be to discard ones own child if said child either fails to meet expectations or for the child to be a painful reminder of a spouse who had left or betrayed the parent in some way and the child who is the product of the two parents ends up as a scapegoat for the bitter feelings toward the spouseBroadly speaking the destruction of an item in a fit of Its All Junk can be quite sad chances are the audience will feel much the same about what the thing represents as the character does If its something established to have a personality a pet or Empathic Weapon it can be downright heartbreakingCertain significant items however may refuse to be discardedThis can also result in some irony if Always Need What You Gave Up is involved as the seemingly useless gift or deadweight item theyve finally gotten rid of turns out to be a vital Plot Coupon they now have to dig out of a dumpster or trawl a lake for In the worst cases this can be a A Tragedy of Impulsiveness as that unopened letter they just turned into confetti and burned turns out to have had some vital information that they cant get back now,4092

Suspiciously Specific Denial,My Not involved in human trafficking Tshirt has people asking a lot of questions already answered by my shirt—Mike GinnCertainly no one is describing Suspiciously Specific Denial here so that people will understand what the trope is about And this sure isnt an opening gag to preface it And this surely isnt an unnecessary prolongation of the gag to make it supposedly funnierA False Reassurance works because the speaker is being vague and nonspecific enough to pull the wool over someones eyes A Suspiciously Specific Denial on the other hand fails because the speaker is Saying Too Much This may be unintentional such as when the speaker is panicked is a Bad Liar or perhaps just a little stupid Often used to establish that youre Most Definitely Not a VillainSometimes this is used more deliberately such as when the speaker is definitely not trying to give out information that they shouldnt but doesnt want to be too obvious about it Or So I Heard may follow The Trickster may also use it as the misdirecting component of a Batman Gambit Infraction Distraction or Kansas City Shuffle by making an oddly specific denial that is actually true the mark may be led to believe that the denial is false For example the mark is told that there arent 2300009 invisible vampire ghosts — so the mark believes there are when in fact there are no invisible vampire ghosts at all In rare cases the speaker may be telling the truth and have no intent to deceive but it just comes out wrongOddly it can happen in two opposite ways the specific denial I wont kill you using a poisoned stiletto was a lie he does and the fact that the question andor answer was so specific means that someone already had the answer in mind or the specific denial was technically true but it left so many doors open that it was suspect anyway he kills the other guy with a nonpoisoned stiletto or a gun Either way the result is the same  when someone is more specific than they need to be its a good sign somethings wrong Bonus suspicion points if the statement was made apropos of nothingIts also related to Compliment Fishing where someone will make a suspiciously specific SelfDeprecation in the hopes that other people will spot the denial and contradict themWhen the speaker is assumed to be telling the truth a listener might suspect this if the denial was expected to be more generalWhen a criminal organization does it for their business its Totally Not a Criminal Front If you insist that youd NEVER make a Suspiciously Specific Denial while doing so then its Ill Never Tell You What Im Telling You This is not comparable to Bad Liar a character who invokes this trope could certainly be a bad liar but when used alone its not indicative of Bad LiarThis is frequently seen on Police Procedurals when someone under a confidentiality requirement lawyers and doctors mostly make a very specific inclusion or omission in an answer to the investigators that provides a clue where they should be lookingIt is also a device in mysteries Someone makes a statement or denial including information that they could only know if they were the perp Well I didnt shoot him No one ever mentioned how he was killed That may also be related to You Just Told Me This is the reason why it is also Truth in Television especially why lawyers frequently advise not to make any reply to any allegationA suspiciously specific denial can also be part of a Gilligan Cut eg Youll never get me to wear a pink polkadotted tutu with a blue sweater and purple highheels Description Cut Its not a rundown house with holes in the roof broken windows and bloodstains on the kitchen walls etcFinally this is a favored tactic of a Tsundere who got caught being sweet — in fact Memetic Mutation has made this the motto of the Tsundere Stupid love interest Iits not like Im doing something affectionate because I like you or anythingCharacters who are Lawful Stupid or Oblivious to Love in the case of the Tsundere may take a Suspiciously Specific Denial at face valueSee also Could Say It ButSuper Trope of Have I Mentioned I Am Sexually Active Today and Peoples Republic of TyrannyCompare AsbestosFree Cereal I Never Said It Was Poison Its for a Book Nightmare Fuel Station Attendant Or So I Heard Overly Narrow Superlative Saying Too MuchContrast False Reassurance Blatant Lies and Implausible DeniabilityComparecontrast with Hesitation Equals DishonestyOften accompanies Mock Surprise Reaction,4439

Women Are Wiser,Top Simpsons women all successful businesswomen Bottom Simpsons men all boorish losersThe third character is The Girl You know girls — those mysterious creatures you see on the bus who have their own bathrooms and spray stingy liquid in your face If you dont know much about girls because your conversations with them dont last for more than a few minutes before the police are called just use your mum as a frame of reference characterizing the female as a disapproving eyerolling nanny who tolerantly wipes up the whoopsies of the idiot manchildren and chastises them with the occasional spanking— Ben Yahtzee Croshaw Zero Punctuation WebcomicsIn some works of fiction the female members of a group be it a married couple siblings True Companions or the cast of characters in general are portrayed as inherently better grounded than the male members more rational more reasonable more levelheaded and sensible and often morally superior This is most common in comedy but occasionally turns up in other genresNote that this trope is not about any specific instance of individual female characters being particularly sensible but about depictions in which female characters are automatically positioned as more levelheaded than their male counterpartsThis is often not a net positive trope for the female characters themselves while in some works it is invoked as an honest attempt to refute the trope Men Are Better Than Women it often has the effect especially in comedy of shifting the burden of responsibility onto women for the actions of everyone around them as well as themselves Men can be portrayed as undeserving of blame for making an interpersonal mistake or not knowing how to do a chore because women are supposedly just naturally better at that sort of thing A common version of this is the widely held belief that girl children mature faster than boys which can be used to excuse boys behavior rather than to commend girls It can also pigeonhole them into being less interesting than their male counterparts since they arent allowed to be flawed to the same degree for a classic example if theres a single woman in a comedy she will probably be the Straight Man which often translates to her being the most boring characterThe likelihood of this trope occurring is inversely linked to how many women are in the cast More female characters mean they have to fill more roles outside of the Only Sane Man resulting in female characters who are just as insensible if not more so than the male characters As a result in a mostly female cast with only The One Guy it will be incredibly unlikely that every female character will be wiser than the sole maleIn advertisements its common for a woman to represent the advertisers product while a man represents the competition or for women to be savvy consumers while men are Too Incompetent to Operate a Blanket The woman patiently explains or demonstrates the superiority of the advertisers product to the clueless man This has roots in the resurgence of the middleclass housewife role in the 1950s and 60s when advertisers knew they could sell more products by convincing women they were experts on consumerism and to this day it is especially pronounced in cleaning product ads that air during the day and are targeted at housewivesIn actionoriented works where both this trope and Men Are the Expendable Gender are in play men will use violence in the wrong way or primarily to protect the wiser women See Force and Finesse or Scientist vs SoldierA form of Double Standard in that it holds women to an impossible ideal and depicts men as naturally stupider Compare Females Are More Innocent Mother Nature Father Science Higher Education Is for Women and Mars and Venus Gender Contrast often overlaps with Dysfunctional Family Sage Love Interest and Men Are Childish Often combined with Ugly Guy Hot Wife Foolish Husband Responsible Wife and with Henpecked Husband where the husband is then portrayed as deserving the henpecking More than often enacted through a Right WayWrong Way Pair Exaggerated this can become Wet Blanket Wife Contrast Hysterical Woman Clingy Jealous Girl Psycho ExGirlfriend Woman Scorned and My Beloved Smother Opposite Trope to Men Are Better Than Women,4237
Donut Mess with a Cop,Just doin his job but isnt that cannibalismIf you want to find all the cops theyre hanging out in the donut shop— The Bangles Walk Like an EgyptianIn fiction its much more probable that youll see a cop eating a donut than anyone else except for Homer Simpson The cop guarding your jail cell is often seen dunking their donut with pink frosting or similar in their cup of coffee The cop in the stakeout may have a halfempty box of donuts in their car When taking a break from driving they commonly hang out at the donut shopIn more humorous displays the cop might react to a donut as ScoobyDoo would to a scooby snack Donuts may be the defining motivation for them to have joined the force In fact Officer Donut is a casual insult for a cop A police character might be so obsessed that they could be bribed to do anything for donutsIn actuality the historic association between police officers and donuts is less insulting and Makes Sense In Context for practical reasons Cops will usually consume lots of coffee because its necessary for them to stay awake during the night and the donut pairs well as a sweet to dunk in coffee or to remove its bitter aftertaste Donuts are also readymade boxed for easy storage do not melt or get inedible when old and tend to be both filling and cheap And since bakers want to have a fresh batch ready to sell every morning donut shops tend to open very early and some stay open all night For a while they were among the few places open for someone working the graveyard shift Donut shops also tend to give out free donuts to law enforcement partly as a public service and partly to encourage cops to hang around and robbers to stay awayAs donuts are fattening sweets the cop munching them is commonly portrayed as a fat lazy mustachioed Obstructive Bureaucrat Strangely they never get glaze or frosting in their mustacheAs for Dirty Cops just remember that Evil Tastes Good — as do donuts And Rabid Cops might scarf them down with excessive zeal and no restraint the same way they do their job But if this trope brought into positive portrayals especially as Cowboy Cops a cop who munches donuts or other desserts voraciously can be sometimes portrayed as a Genius Sweet Tooth If the cop is an anthropomorphic animal they may be portrayed as a pig since this works well as a reference to both pigs reputation as animals that eat a lot and a Visual Pun of pig as derogatory slang for the policeWhile this might be Truth in Television it could probably be seen today as an Evolving Trope If anything a cop might be hesitant in buying donuts because of the inevitable stigma associated with them On the other hand The Red Stapler effect comes into play On their first round a rookie might buy some donuts for the station believing that all cops love them But then everyone does so its fair They might subvert this trope by eating different kinds of sweets instead like cupcakes or brownies,2922

EarlyBird Cameo,Sonics first appearance was a cameo in the 1991 arcade racing game Rad Mobile You can see him dangling near the top of the windshield— Sonics Origins Super Smash Bros for Wii UAn EarlyBird Cameo is when characters appear earlier than their proper introduction in the same work or continuitySuch a cameo is superficially similar to the Chekhovs Gunman with the difference being that the Gunmans introduction later in the work coincides with them becoming a plotresolver while an EarlyBird Cameo is more along the lines of Bob appears in the background in chapter 1 yet joins the main cast only in chapter 5An EarlyBird Cameo can come in different flavors Either the character has their cameo without any actual characterization or they get a small role as themselves including characterization before their main role  for example being a side villain in one film and the Big Bad of its sequel There is also the habit of studios to promote new characters of an upcoming release by letting them cameo at the end of a work which is called a Sneak PeekCompare this trope with Adaptational Early Appearance A character or other element of a story appears earlier in an adaptation than they did in the original work Ascended Extra A background or minor character becomes a major character CallForward A prequel references a character or plot device from the original Chekhovs Gunman A fleetingly introduced character turns out to play a role in resolving the main plot Continuity Cameo A character from a previous incarnation of a work of fiction appears in the remake or reboot as a Mythology Gag Marth Debuted in Smash Bros A characters first appearance in another country is in a cameo Production Foreshadowing Cameo and introduction of a character or object happen within different continuities by the same production company Retroactive Recognition An actor or actress appears in an earlier work before they become famous,1920
No Celebrities Were Harmed,Subtle BlizzDude I shot this guy yesterday and I swear to god he looked just like Jimmy Fallon— PROTOTYPE 2Sometimes a characters entire shtick will be that he or she is a thinly disguised imitation of some celebrity somewhere The more blatant examples will often have a parody of that celebritys name This can be done for various reasons such as to serve as a homage andor parody to make a point using the character or simply because the writers think that it would be cool Though some consider it done because the writers are out of ideas Many creators and viewers alike do not like it because it tends to smack of unoriginality and destroys the conceit that the works universe is entirely fictional though of course if the work is outright going for realism its quite appropriate However this does have the side effect of making the work an Unintentional Period Piece for the period of the works creation as later audiences to varying degrees of success can see through the thinly disguised part of the parody and clearly determine that the work was made during the height of the targets popularity  or infamyThe most common impressions to hear in cartoons are Jack Nicholson Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone for toughguy characters Peter Lorre or Vincent Price for creepy characters R Lee Ermey for Drill Sergeant Nasties Maurice Chevalier for a song and dance man or a French Funny Foreigner character Paul Lynde for Camp Gay characters Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee for vampires Boris Karloff for Frankensteins monster Sean Connery or Don Adams for secret agents Donald Pleasence or Alan Rickman for an action villain Ed Wynn for assorted silly characters John Wayne or Clint Eastwood for cowboys Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin for Australians Howard Cosell or John Madden for sports announcers Joe Pesci or Ray Liotta for mobsters and Mae West for vamps As for more general examples heavymetal rocker characters will be given a Metal Scream of the sort perfected by the likes of Robert Plant Steven Tyler and Rob Halford Stoner characters will be based on either the Sean Penn character Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High or the Dennis Hopper character in Apocalypse Now Anyone doing a pirate character Ahrrr matey is paying tribute to Robert Newtons performance as Long John Silver in Disneys Treasure Island 1950 The witch stereotype is based on The Wicked Witch of the WestMay double as a Parental Bonus when it is mostly aimed at kidsIf its a fictional character thats being imitated then its an Expy or Captain Ersatz The trope does not apply in the case of adaptations of liveaction source materials where the character designs are obliged to be based on the real actors When the creators actively deny that the character was meant to be caricature of the person see Denied ParodyCompare InkSuit Actor where a celebrity voices an animated caricature of themself ComicBook Fantasy Casting is a much milder version of this where a real actor or other celebrity is used as a guide for a characters appearance but with no attempt to caricature their persona Write Who You Know is for where a character is based on somebody who the creator personally knows but not necessarily a celebrity If the famous personality is an historical character that is already dead especially its from centuries ago then its No Historical Figures Were Harmed If the whole work is based on real events but without using real names its a Roman à ClefNote that some character voices most notably those reminiscent of Peter Lorre or John Wayne are by now fourthgeneration copies that have more to do with earlier impressions than with the original actors voices There may also be some overlap with Parody Displacement if the caricature is more familiar to younger audiences than the actual celebritySee also LawyerFriendly Cameo No Communities Were Harmed and Adam Westing See BlandName Product for the equivalent treatment of a product or possibly a business entity rather than a person potentially applying just as much detail to the parody Contrast Invisible Celebrity Guest and Invisible President where its made clear that theyre a real person theyre just never seen onscreen,4178

Handwriting As Characterization,Audrey that rightward slant in your handwriting indicates a romantic nature A heart that yearns be careful— Dale Cooper Twin PeaksJust as a persons accent or speech patterns can provide insights into their personality so can something like their handwriting For instance A meticulous refined person could have neat handwriting and in more recent works use cursive nearexclusively Smart characters especially doctors are often portrayed as having messy handwriting This is based on the idea that thinking faster may cause one to write faster and therefore less legibly — while this is the case for some people there is no direct correlation between ones intelligence and handwriting legibility A person who writes certain letters in a reversed fashion may either be portrayed as someone with childish whimsy or is a literal child themselvesIn Real Life this discipline is called graphology the inference of ones personality from their handwriting — though it is considered a pseudoscience at bestSupertrope to The Illegible See also Art Reflects Personality,1056

Police Lineup,Lining up suspects for witnesses to point out who did itA Truth in Television trope but fiction often plays with it Police lineups in the real world usually only involve one suspect mixed in with a bunch of similarlooking extras The idea isnt so much to identify the suspect but rather to confirm that the witness can reliably pick them out from a crowd This is Serious Business because the selfreinforcing nature of memory means that a witness who makes a misidentification once becomes more and more certain the more times they repeat the mistake So if the witness cant pick the right person out of the lineup and in some cases the actual suspect may not even BE in the lineup at all then their testimony cant be used as evidence against that suspect in a court of lawFiction on the other hand seems to be running with the notion that the cops either arrested everyone they could find who vaguely fit the description or just rounded up a bunch of local lowlifes and need the witness to tell them which one they get to lock up this week Thus a lot of fictional police lineups will feature a varied and colourful collection of scoundrels with little in common Bonus points if there isnt even a common race or gender in the group Shots along these lines are sometimes used to show the main cast of a series and to imply that theyre all unsavory characters or criminalsSome aspects of this trope also seem to be be conflated with photographing perps during processing since both involve criminal suspects standing in front of a brightlylit wall with demarcated height measurements Of course that would imply that everyones mugshot is a magnification of a larger group portrait which is just silly,1694
